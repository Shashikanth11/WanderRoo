Great location, short walk to the metro and there are shops and a good pub close by.\nWe had a great stay. The apartment is big and comfortable to be in. Really enjoyed being in Sydney\nWe really enjoyed staying in Sanchia\u2019s home. Very chill atmosphere, comfortable and well decorated. Yoga mat for morning exercise. The apartment is a very short walk to the trains on the airport line, and a quick trip to Central station or Circular Quay. We found nice restaurants in the area that could cater to gluten free dairy free diets. We would definitely stay again\nSanchia's place is a fantastic base for exploring Sydney - very well connected to the city. The apartment is spacious and well equipped, we enjoyed having breakfast on the balcony after a dip in the pool. <br\/>Sanchia took the time to show us around the apartment complex which was very kind \/ helpful. <br\/>We would choose Sanchia's place again when we return to Sydney!\nWhat a lovely stay! Great area, lovely host. Would stay again\nThe airbnb is a neat and very comfortable place to stay in. The area is a very quiet place and close to basically everything; restaurants, activities, stores, station etc. The only downside to this airbnb was no air-conditioning, I would find myself just sitting under the fan to cool off.\nWe had a wonderful stay of 10 nights at Sanchia's apartment in Sydney. <br\/>The apartment was exactly as described and had absolutely everything we needed. It was very clean and ready to use, and also situated no more than 5 minutes from Green Square Station.<br\/>Furthermore, Sanchia was an excellent host.... always friendly, ready to help and responding very quickly. <br\/>Thank you, Sanchia. This was great!<br\/>Highly recommended.\nMe and my Girlfriend stayed for a week in Sydney at Sanchias place. We have never been to Australia before and it was the perfect start for us. We felt right at home! <br\/>The apartment had everything we needed and more. We needed somewhere with a well equipped kitchen and it had it all. The ceiling fans make a massive difference each with different settings and multiple lighting options available too. The sofa was so comfy and we both slept well every night as the bed was too!  <br\/>Really good location with Green Square station about a 5 minute walk away and Waterloo station just a little more. Meaning you can get into the CBD quickly. There are supermarkets and places all within close proximity. <br\/>I would highly recommend staying here. One of the best Air BnB\u2019s we have stayed in and hopefully we will return one Day! <br\/>Special thanks to Sanchia for being a friendly and responsive host :)\nVi har haft 2 fantastiske uger i lejligheden.

We stayed for 1 week and it was very comfortable, with amenities in the pantry, we felt like home. Sanchia was responsive from the beginning, easy to communicate with and checked in as well during our stay.  The location is great with access to Green Square train station, to both the airport and cbd only minutes away. Great cafes, restaurants, parks and a lovely library too are very close. Thanks for everything Sanchia! Highly recommended :)\nSanchia\u2019s place was very clean, perfect for a cozy winter stay as there are heaters inside the room. The location was ideal and close to both the train & bus stops.\nLovely flat in Alexandria, close to the Woolworth\u2019s , IGA and other restaurants. The flat was very clean and had everything we need. Sanchia is also very responsive and a kind host.\nAn excellent stay for us.

Man kann ja auch die Fenster morgens schlie\u00dfen. <br\/>Der Preis war an der Grenze. <br\/>Dennoch, es hat mir gefallen.\nThe apartment is safe and secure.  It offers a suitable kitchen, good-sized bathroom, and pool.  We appreciated the great washer and dryer, beautiful balcony with lush plants, parking spot, large smart TV, comfortable reclining sofa, and all just step away from Manly Beach.  Elizabeth provides an orientation tour so you know where everything is located in the building and apartment.\nGreat location and good sized unit just off the main corso and a 1 minute walk to the beach.  Well appointed apartment with all the features you need.\nA fantastic stay. The unit was the best furnished that we\u2019ve even seen. Lots of linen, blanket and towel options. The kitchen amenities had everything any cook could hope for. The location of the complex can\u2019t be beat. Hospitality and communication was exceptional.\nThe location is great close to both beaches. A good selection of shops and restaurants are nearby. The ferries to Sydney are 3 minutes walk away and the bus station about the same. The area is a mixture of residential and commercial so at certain times of the day it can get noisy. The apartment has a car parking space which is very useful since parking is very restricted round about.  \nI was very familiar with the location and apartment complex so it was an easy choice.   The location is in the heart of everything you will want or need.  Restaurants, beach, ferry to Sydney were all steps away.   \r<br\/>The host Elizabeth was very welcoming and a pleasure to work with.  She was very accommodating and very accessible.  Elizabeth responded quickly to any questions or requests.   \r<br\/>The apartment was well equipped with everything you will need.  My wife loves to cook and found the kitchen supplied with all the pots, pans and utensils she needed.   One of the best features is easy access to the pool and spa.  If you have young visitors like I did they will love it.  The only negative, and I hate to even mention it since there are so many pluses, is the street noise in the morning.   It can be a bit irritating.  Unfortunately this is something the host has no control over.   \r<br\/>\r<br\/>"}

They are delightful people and we thoroughly enjoyed their company. <br\/>Beacon Hills  is a residential area but is within easy reach of the Northern beaches. It would benefit you to have a car but the local bus service is excellent and can get you anywhere you want to go.

Very hot in fact.

You can see a lot of beautiful greenery from the windows and even the ocean from the kitchen.<br\/>The area just outside the apartment has outdoor furniture for eating and relaxing. The back yard is very secluded and has a hot tub, and the front yard with the hammock and a seating area is open to guests as well. Additionally, Toni and Victor always welcome their guests to enjoy the upstairs patio.<br\/>The area is safe and quiet and the house is within a walking distance from several bus stops, the closest of which is only a three minute walk away. We took public transit to Dee Why, Manly, various beaches, and Sydney all the time. Grocery stores can also be quickly reached by bus (10-15 minutes for the closest of them), and of course even quicker by car.<br\/>Toni and Victor are very kind and welcoming. They always made sure we had everything we needed, were very helpful, and responded to messages quickly.

Not only was it a lovely space but all of the appliances were top notch, with plenty of dinnerware to go with it. The host had the house ready for us when we arrived and provided us with some fruits and snacks that us to relax on arrival, instead of rushing out to get food. Thank you for being an outstanding host.\nDan and Eduardo were wonderful hosts - they were easy to communicate with and were extremely understanding and accommodating. Their home was exactly as described and was well located, within close proximity to cafes, shops, and public transport. Made our stay very pleasant. Will definitely stay here again if I\u2019m back in Sydney\nGorgeous Federation town house, exactly as pictured. Great location, short 10min walk to central train station and light rail stop. Really nice restaurants nearby and the local pub close by has amazing food and great staff, and as close as it is there is no late night noise. The stairs up to the bedroom are a little steep and narrow but that\u2019s what you expect for an old home. Hosts were amazing, quick to respond, really helpful. Highly recommend and would stay again.\nGreat little townhouse in a beautiful location. Quiet and peaceful. Highly recommend!\nThe location is superb. The fruit and other items was a nice touch.

{"listing_id":1937096,"comments":"Great restaurants downstairs, close to public transport<br\/>Large for a 1  bedroom\nFantastic host, went over and above in helping me. Extremely responsive. Great place that is really well furnished and maintained. Very clean also, so central to everything. Only small suggestion would be a heater for cold nights.\nOur stay at La's place was awesome! His appartment is very spaceious and stylish. It's located close to the Bondi Beach and Sydneys City Center. From this location your able to expolore each part of Sydney very comfortable. Strongly recommended!\nLa's flat is best described as home away from home, the flat itself its well maintained and has all the amenities. Great view of the common roof top where you can see the downing harbor bridge from a far. Very close to the train and bus terminal (5 mins walk) which made my commute from one place to another very easy - both CBD and bondi beach are just a train and bus a way.  It is very ideal for a short or long stay should you visit Sydney. His flat has an amazing well equipped balcony where i spent most of the time unwinding when i am around the flat. The only regret is that i don't get to use the bbq facility which i think would be cool.\r<br\/>Minor challenge for some perhaps (which in the first few days i find it very challenging) is that this flat is not equipped with AC.. so if you are a person who is used to have this fixture in your home this would be a deal breaker especially in the summer when you come home from all the day's walk.. but nonetheless La's flat has couple of fan to make sure your stay cool. Shame i don't get to meet him in person but by the sound of our communication by message and over the phone I'm sure his one heck of a nice fella. Best part.. easy to communicate and too efficient to respond to any inquiries you have. Thanks for an awesome stay!\nBrilliant pad, thanks for hosting\nWicked place to rent\nSuch a great location and clean and tidy. If I had to contact La with any enquiry he returned the response promptly. Highly recommend this Airbnb. \nAbsolutely loved our stay here! Perfect location, close to everything you need. Thanks for a wonderful stay La. \nLa's cousin awaited us at the apartment on arrival and showed us around. We couldn't have picked a more perfect place for our stay in Sydney. The train station and bus interchange were so close that we could go everywhere we wanted within a short amount of time. The place was quiet at night and the bed comfortable for a good sleep. In the mornings, we had breakfast on the balcony. Loved it and would stay again any time.\nSolid place and neighborhood.  Well lit with a spectacular balcony.\nLa's apartment was very nice. It is in a modern building with good security. The apartment building had multiple cafes too! I enjoyed staying in Bondi Junction.  Bondi Junction has multiple grocery stores, bars, restaurants, and a large shopping center. The transit station was nearby. It was very easy to ride the train from Bondi Junction station to Sydney's central business district. Also, there is frequent bus service from Bondi Junction to Bondi Beach.\r<br\/>\r<br\/>It was easy to communicate with La. He answered my questions promptly.\r<br\/>\r<br\/>One final note: the apartment does not have air conditioning. There is a fan in the bedroom which I used to keep cool.\r<br\/>\nStaying at La's place was very easy.  He was a good communicator when needed.  The apartment has a good feel and is a large space, very clean and tidy.  The location is excellent, we thought we would have trouble parking we had no problems at all.  Its very close to Westfield and a short bus trip or drive to the beach.\r<br\/>Enjoying a drink on the deck was great at the end of the day although you can only see a bit of the harbour.  It can be a bit noisy first thing in the morning with the garbage trucks so if you want to sleep in it is better to keep the doors closed.\r<br\/>Overall we had a very good experience and I would recommend this apartment...especially if you like shopping!\nMy daughter and I stayed at La's place in Bondi from Dec. 31- Jan. 5th. From start to finish, La responded quickly to all my messages and helped make our stay an enjoyable one. He accommodated our early checkin without any problem and even had his lovely mother meet us and show us the gorgeous rooftop view of the harbor. When I asked if he had a blowdryer prior to our trip, he said that he would have one ready for our stay. I was surprised to see a brand new blowdryer, still in its packaging, waiting for us to use! His place looks just as great as the photos. It's clean and spacious with a huge balcony that has a water view. The location is central and convenient. I would highly recommend La's place and feel fortunate to have stayed there.\nLa's apartment was absolutely fantastic to stay in! It was very well kept and clean, the facilities were excellent and we enjoyed the rooftop views you'll have access to. The location was perfect, with plenty of great restaurants\/cafes right downstairs and Westfield just a few minutes' walk away. La himself was very friendly and good to deal with once we met. \nLa's place was great! <br\/>The bus stop to Bondi Beach right at the front door, Bondi Jct Station with Bus\/Train access into the CBD an easy 5 Min walk away and many Cafes \/ Restaurants and the Westfield Shopping Center around the Apt - lot's of choices!<br\/>La's Apt is huge, spacy, very tasteful decorated and clean, with a huge balcony - exactly as shown in the pictures!<br\/>La is a very nice host and very responsive if you have any questions.<br\/>We enjoyed our stay here very much - thank you La!"}

Disappointed that the quote we received to extend our stay by 2 nights at the same nightly rate as we paid for the accommodation was significantly more expensive\nEverything mentioned was working and all items required were thoughtfully provided. Great location as well. Clean and neat.\nJulia's place is very nice little bolthole in Darlinghurst. Quiet, and the amenities were high quality and well maintained. Only thing I'd improve is to update the bed and mattress, as those were a little tired, but everything else was great. That terrace flowing into the living room into the kitchen is gorgeous.\nWe loved our stay here \u2013 really terrific part of Sydney, so close to everything. Home is super clean and the balcony is perfect for enjoying the light and feeling at home.\nJulia's apartment was in a quiet location right near five ways in Paddington.  So easy to grab food from Woolies Central, cafes, restaurants all two minute walk away.  The apartment is at the back of complex,  it's got a great deck overlooking the inner city houses.  It all felt private, quiet and relaxing.  My only suggestion if I may add, a top sheet on the bed would be great during the summer months.  When a doona is too hot to sleep under.<br\/>All in all perfect.  Thank you for letting us stay.\nReally gorgeous neat unit in perfect location. Lovely light in house and easy to use kitchen.<br\/>Lovely aspect and access to cafes and can even walk to Sydney around 30 minutes.<br\/>We loved staying there as it felt both like home and holiday.\nGreat little place to be central to everything\nLovely place - gorgeous quiet area close to all amenities.\nJulia\u2019s place is so good I want to keep it secret and all to myself!  Easy location with accessible amenities, great veranda and cooling breeze. Loads of nearby pubs and restaurants and an easy walk to anywhere exciting in the eastern suburbs - only 55 minutes to Bronte to Bondi walk if that takes your fancy and even the bus for the return journey!\nThis Airbnb is in a great location in Paddington. Cafes nearby, the metro and bus stations. Unfortunately there were a few things that were disappointing. Only 2 towels were given for 3 guest (2 adults and 1 infant). Julia\u2019s team said infants aren\u2019t provided towels but that doesn\u2019t make sense, they still need to be bathed. Only 1 toilet roll was provided for 3 nights so we had to buy more. There was only 1 soap in the bathroom, none in the kitchen which also ran out after a day so needed to buy more soap. The bed slats also came apart and the bed sunk in when we first lay down. Julia\u2019s team offered for a handy man to come and fix it but we didn\u2019t feel comfortable having someone come in whilst we weren\u2019t there. Julia\u2019s teams communication was good but it didn\u2019t meet our expectations.\nJulia\u2019s place is lovely and in a great location.  Julia ran into a technical difficulties with the place so I was not able to staying at the place but Julia was very responsive or it was quickly sorted out.\nJulia's home in sensational. Excellent location, walk to everything, great transport.....This was my second stay and everything was perfect - home away from home. Thank you Julia.\namazing ! felt so cosy and homely\nWe had two wonderful nights at Julia's place. the location was fantastic, park across the road to walk the dogs, supermarket a block away, fun cafes around, and a short walk to Oxford St, Kings Cross (if we felt like it). The team were super responsive to questions, and the place was immaculate. We hope to be back!\nJulia's place is an excellent base for being in Sydney. It is very quiet and in a super location, and it provides everything you need. Definitely recommended as a place to stay."}

We had to drop our bags off and although we were told there was a bag drop room, we were told to leave our bags on the sofa in the reception waiting area. When we arrived back to check in 6 hours later, the bags were still on the sofa so they hadn't been safely kept anywhere. <br\/>The apartment itself is as advertised.

Doug was great at communicating and was kind enough to extend our check out. Thank you for the stay!\nEssentially a funky, artistic place with a beautiful setting.  However there is a gas leak that prevented us from sitting outside, and even the kitchen at times smelled strongly of gas.  Also noisy construction next door which I was not informed about before arrival. As I left I alerted Doug to the problems but never heard back which as a superhost myself, was rather shocking - no apology, no concern.\nvery relaxing, comfortable environmen and when the tide was in the fishing was surprisingly good .<br\/>Very enjoyable weekend, thankyou very much Doug.<br\/>can't wait till next time\nWe stayed at Doug\u2019s place over a weekend, the check in process was easy his communication was great and the property was very private and relaxing, would recommend.\nGreat place, better than the photos!!<br\/>Would stay again!!\nDouglas' property is one of the few houses where you can access the sea directly from the backyard, which was the main reason I chose it. In the morning, my husband can walk to a fishing spot in just 5 minutes to fish. In the evening, when the tide is low, we can walk barefoot straight into the sea. We take our kids kayaking, enjoying the peaceful world under the sunset glow. This is the life of leisure I\u2019ve always dreamed of. Nothing else matters. This house gives me everything I wanted, and I am very satisfied.\nGreat place, and Doug was a very responsive and flexible host. unfortunately, there is fairly serious construction works going on next door, causing a HUGE amount of noise, from 7am to 3.30pm. This somewhat ruins the sought-after peaceful vibe.\nA beautiful location  matched only by the house. Lovely amenities and really good communication. Thank you.\nDouglas\u2019s place was fantasic, and he was a brilliant host. From start to finish, his communication was clear and very responsive. Easy to find, beautiful home, and brilliant amenities. Easy access, great location and a brilliant host.

We just had a few cleaning issues. <br\/>Otherwise, a wonderful stay that I'll never forget. Thanks Doug :)\nHighly recommend staying at Doug\u2019s house. The location is beautiful - so peaceful! Thanks for a great stay\nGreat configuration of rooms for 6 people to stay.  Currently major construction beside this home so from 7am to 4pm is very noisy, so for a weeks stay it is not very restful.  If you want a quieter stay you could go for Friday night and leave before the noise starts again on Monday at 7am.<br\/>There is plenty of amenities albeit they are all a little tired.  The outlook is lovely and would be fantastic once the major works finishes next door.  Plenty of great restaurants near by and Newport beach is fab.  You can also drop a fishing line out the front which is fun.  Good swimming pool for when the tide is out.<br\/>Doug is very responsive and there is plenty of information on the rules of the house.\nGreat host. Beautiful place."}

Everything you may need for your stay is provided and Randel was a very friendly and responsive host. The apartment is in a fantastic location for getting around Sydney with a train station just around the corner and lots of bus options.  Restaurants, cafes and shops are all close by. I would highly recommend Randel's apartment to anyone coming to Sydney for a holiday.\nI recently spent four months at an Airbnb in Bondi Junction and had an excellent experience. The apartment complex featured top-notch amenities, including a nice gym, a refreshing pool, and a relaxing sauna. Parking was easy and convenient, which made my stay even more hassle-free. The location was ideal, offering quick access to local shops, cafes, and public transport. The host was incredibly accommodating and responsive, making sure all my needs were met. Overall, it was a fantastic stay, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-equipped place in Bondi Junction.\nAmazing place to stay - the location of the studio is the best in the region. Only a few steps away from big shopping centers like Eastgate and Westfield where you'll find everything you need (supermarkets, pharmacies, clothing stores..). Buses take you to the best beaches within 10 - 20 minutes (Bondi, Coogee, Bronte), but it's also possible to walk to the beach within around 30 mins. Great view from the studio to the airport and the sea. Loved that there was also a gym and a rooftop pool which is rare in the area. Randel has been a great host - very friendly, always willing to help, understanding and supportive. I knew I could always reach out to him with any issues.

However, the washing machine needed a replacement, and the little office room in the corner was too hot to go in because the generator for the fan was in there. Parking is also pretty confusing at first. But overall, a great deal and an amazing location to live in long term. The owner is very nice, quick to respond and very helpful.\nRandel was really helpful and caring to my friend and I for our short stay in Sydney. The location of the apartment is very prime and was perfect for all our needs.

The Tamarama area is lovely, the beaches, and the coastal walk. And so easy access to everything.\nGreat apartment, great view, great location, great host. Very easy holiday.\nSuch a fantastic stay! Great location that\u2019s walking distance to Bondi and surrounding beaches, beautiful deck area that overlooks the water. Eric was great to deal with and went above and beyond the standard airbnb experience. Would highly recommend!\nWe would definitely recommend booking here . The location is superb , views stunning with ample outside space to enjoy them . Ample indoor space too with quirky decor. The hosts were lovely , helpful and welcoming . There are little added extras like lorikeet s coming to say hello on balcony , our kids loved this \ud83d\ude01. We would book here again\nInsane view in this funky pad in Tamarama beach! The host was wonderful and very thoughtful. Fun artistic touches all over the place. Daily visits from the lorikeets. To wake up and see the sunrise on the penthouse Terrance was unforgettable. Close to Bondi, yet far enough away for some peace and quiet.\nThis is just a fantastic place to stay if you want to explore Sydney and be close to the fantastic Bondi Beach. Eric and Phaedra are excellent hosts and very helpful. The place is clean and there's just no hassle in regards to checking in or out or communication in general. All in all just a very good experience and we highly recommend this place for other travellers.\nThanks to Phaedra and Eric for hosting us. This penthouse is a fantastic holiday accommodation for big families coming to Sydney~ it has got wonderful location and nice decoration style:) they are very thoughtful hosts who have always communicated promptly and gave us heaps of tips of how to maximize our time in Sydney and Bondi region. We had a wonderful time here!  My son has enjoyed the toys they left out for him and the snacks too! Beautiful family and wonderful hosts!\nThe location excellent, walking distance to Bus stop, Bondi beach walking track."}

Nick and Antonette are wonderful hosts, very personable and welcoming.\nWould definitely recommend.  Like staying in an island resort in the middle of Sydney.\nThe views were just amazing. <br\/>Loved hearing the animals at the zoo across the water. <br\/>Nick and Antoinette were the perfect hosts. Quickly attended to a minor issue. <br\/>Very comfortable studio. Plenty of room for 2 people. <br\/>Easy to get to south Mosman ferry   A short 5-10 min walk. <br\/>Would highly recommend\n\uc774\uc219\uc18c\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0\ub85c \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ud48d\uad11\uc744 \ubcfc\uc218\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \ud398\ub9ac\uc815\uac70\uc7a5\uc774 \uac00\uae4c\uc6cc\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uac00\uc778 \uc11c\ud058\ub7ec\ud0a4\ub85c \uc27d\uac8c\ub098\uac08\uc218\uc788\uace0 \ubaa8\uc2a4\ub9cc\uc758 \uc870\uc6a9\ud55c\uc8fc\ud0dd\uac00\ub97c \uc990\uae38\uc218\uc788\uc5b4 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\nLovely peaceful spot, fantastic view from all areas, comfortable bed.<br\/>Brekkie start off food provided.  Some steps to go down to reach the private flat. Plenty of parking on their quiet street available. Short drive to shops, scenic and walking spots and harbour beaches.<br\/>Thank you Nick and Antoinette.\nNick and Antoinette thank you so much for having us! The accommodation just oozes charm and character. It has everything one needs including a great coffee machine in a well appointed kitchen, nice modern bathroom and very comfortable bed. The location itself honestly delivered in spades. Hearing the lions and the chimpanzees at night from across Sirius Cove over at Taronga Zoo was such a fantastic experience. Starting the day with a coffee on the deck watching the boats on the water was a highlight too. You were both such great hosts and have perfected that balance between giving guests privacy as well as catching up for a chat, giving local recommendations etc. The other thing worth mentioning is the stressfree parking. The property is on a quiet street where only locals park so finding a parking spot was a breeze. Thanks again and next time we're down I'll definitely be checking to see if it's available!\nNick and Antoinette are amazing hosts and their studio had everything I needed as a solo traveler.  You can walk to the beach or zoo and it\u2019s easy to get to Mosman Village and city by bus and ferry.  In addition to the amazing view the location is so calm and peaceful that I didn\u2019t mind when some rain forced me to stay in.\nAn absolutely gorgeous location, and Nick and Antoinette are very friendly hosts. We loved our stay and would definitely return!\nThis is such a beautiful place to stay, with gorgeous direct views of Sirius Cove from all windows. <br\/>Well designed space with thoughtful inclusions (cereal, bread, milk plus coffee\/tea), comfortable bed and everything spotless.  Shower is great.<br\/>Tucked away under the hosts house, at the bottom of 3 flights of stairs, this is a perfect little place to enjoy being on Sydney Harbour. Lovely friendly hosts. <br\/>Ferry is about a 10 min walk and takes about 15 minutes to reach Circular Quay. Local shopping street about a 20 minute walk or head down to the small beach at Sirius Cove in 5 mins. But be prepared for plenty of stairs !\nWe were sad not to have spent more time in this beautiful apartment- what a view! <br\/>Waking up to the sun and sea - with both mosquito nets and blinds, perfect!<br\/>Next time we will book less activity in Sydney and enjoy a glass of wine in the terasse and breakfast mangoes.<br\/>No doubt - book it - you won't regret!\nTolle Einliegerwohnung mit viel Morgensonne auf der eigenen Terrasse, traumhafter freier Ausblick auf das Wasser und das in einer recht edlen Wohngegend. Sch\u00f6ner Strand \u00fcber viele Treppen zu erreichen, auch der F\u00e4hranleger ist auf der anderen Bergseite der Landzuge schnell zu erreichen (12min). Aber immer viele Treppen. Vermieter sehr nett, wohnen dar\u00fcber, aber man hat immer seine Privatsph\u00e4re. <br\/>Wir w\u00fcrden sofort wieder buchen. <br\/>Danke !\nVery nice hosts and a great place to stay. The  apartment is extremely well set up. This is a stunning location to stay overlooking the water with yachts at anchor. The surrounding  area is a combination of harbourside housing and bush which is very attractive and full if bird life. Highly recommended Many thanks.\nSome of the best hosts I\u2019ve ever had in an unbelievably beautiful stay!"}

Great apartment, you couldn\u2019t ask for more in central Sydney.\nThe location was super nice. Apartment was also nice, though small for four people, and there were no extra quilts put in for two of us. The ad mentions a \"fully modern kitchen\", however, when we arrived there was no dishwasher. There was also heavy construction noises that began a couple of weeks into our stay and continued for the remainder of our stay. All in all an ok apartment with a great location.\nGreat position and Anthony was a very responsive host. Thoroughly enjoyed being in Elizabeth Bay. And saw the apartment as home during my six month stay.\nA great location with some street noise. A secure building with car park availability. Anthony was a good host.\nGreat location\nAnthony was great to deal with and the place was very clean and convenient\nAnthony\u2019s place is in a brilliant location, the bus is outside and it\u2019s minutes to walk to the parks at Rushcutters and Beare park, and to the best places for coffee and food in Sydney. It\u2019s a little noisy if you like it quiet, only from the road out the front and people chatting early morning on their way to the park. It\u2019s lovely to look out at the trees and to have a verandah to step outside. This is in the best part of Sydney. The bed was comfy and shower pressure is good! It\u2019s also great to have a bath! Complex is fine with friendly neighbours. Any queries including some issues with kitchen gear were addressed quickly.\nA fantastic inner city apartment with secure parking. Close to everything and in a quiet street.\nHost was very accommodating. Place had everything we needed and very convenient location.\nAnthonys place is great! A prime spot for staying in Sydney, nothing is too far and the park close by is great to view the new year fireworks in!\nVery conveniently located flat. 24h checkin and free parking place are big plus. Comfy beds and fully equipped kitchen.  Easy to reach city center (via bus or Elisabeth Bay cruise).\nGreat place. Exactly as described.\nPlace is OK, bit older than the photo suggests.\nWe would recommend this apartment to anyone. It is right next to Rushcutters park. Close to shops. Well equipped, spacious and comfortable.<br\/>Liz and Geoff"}

We definitely would like to stay next time.<br\/>Greetings,<br\/>Cathy\nGreat location and comfortable surroundings.\nWell-appointed 3BR terrace at the east end of Woollahra by Syd Enfield Drive. Nevertheless, supremely quiet, comfy beds, and artsy decor.  No dramas at all - just like staying at your mom\u2019s house after her art-collecting trip to France..\nChris and Max were really nice hosts and easy to get in contact with! The outdoor area was lovely and nice to hang out. Bedrooms are nice and spacious, plenty of room to keep luggage. Good location and easy to get around.  An overall lovely home, decorated nicely with admirable artworks.<br\/>Unfortunately the water pressure in the showers aren\u2019t that great, upstairs shower is also a little difficult to get to the right temperature usually it was either hot or cold. The pillows in the bedrooms are a tad too big making the sleep uncomfortable so I recommend bringing your own pillows."}

Anthony was a good host, provided clear instruction and expectation, and got back to me whenever I reached out to him. I was a little hesitant at first that there was no AC, but the location is uniquely settled into a canopy of trees that provide excellent shade and keeps the place comfortable. Lots of local restaurants, short distance to bus stop or ferry \u2013 we used Uber a lot due to it being very inexpensive there.  Was able to see so much of Sydney and even the blue mountains, would definitely recommend this location and will definitely stay there again. Added bonus is it has a great view of the Sydney harbor bridge from the back patio. A rare and great find. <br\/>Good kitchen, good bathroom, and on-site laundry.\nBeautiful convenient location and comfortable apartment but could really do with some redecorating and maintenance of leaking taps, peeling paint on walls and maybe a few more bits in kitchen. However we did enjoy our time and would stay again as stunning setting.\nGreat location. Easy access to bus stop, shop and reataurants in Neutral Bay by walk 5 mins. Near North Sydney by 10 mins walk for more shop and restaurants. The pick up key is far from the room if you not driving (30 mins walk). If you have a car or taxi it\u2019s not be a ptoblem. Overall I enjoy the place. Make mefeel like home when i stayed. Thank you for sharing nice place.\nApartment is very bright, peacefull and comfortable with amazing views to the reserve. Location is perfect with easy access to public transportation and shops and walk distance to very nice spots in Kirribilli,  Milsons Point and more, a plus is the easy connection to Norh Sydney through Winter Av. A little maintenance to solve very few details would be recommended, however I`d absolutely come back.<br\/>Communication with Anthony was perfect and he kindly accomodated check in to my needs, thank you so much Anthony!\nSuper location with bus, trains, shops, restaurants and cafes nearby, and how many places can boast a bit of Sydney bush right on the doorstep. If you love a walk, the Harbour and Bridge are close by. A tidy unit to base yourself for a couple of days or a fortnight. well worth the rate.\nGood location, nice apartment, however note that there is no WiFi for this AirBNB\nThe setting for this apartment is just brilliant, with the balcony a great place to sit and soak up the view into the woods.  I found it comfortable and convenient - albeit be prepared that North Sydney is a fairly hilly place. I would agree with a previous comment that a bit of a refresh for the place would be good, but I extended my stay twice and could easily imagine staying there again.\nThe apartment is in a nice location with lots of places to eat nearby (although you need to walk up the steep hill to get to them!). It is next to a small nature reserve and there is a lots of birds around which fill the apartment with birdsong in the morning and the evening. The apartment balcony overlooks the nature reserve and is a great place to sit and enjoy a coffee.<br\/>On the negative side, there is no wifi, which is can be problematic, and the laundry arrangement is not great. <br\/>Overall the apartment is clean and tidy but could do with a reset and a refresh.\nLovely location and comfortable apartment\nThis apartment is amazing. The location. The view. The birds. It\u2019s magic. Would stay again.\nGreat experience, wonderful location and beautiful nature views!"}

Lilly\u2019s place is close to so many things (Sydney harbor, Opera house, botanical gardens, art galleries and loads of fantastic restaurants)! Lilly was super kind and gave local recommendations. I only had one day here, but the next time I\u2019m in Sydney I\u2019ll book Lilly\u2019s place!!!\nI had a great stay at Lily's place. It is located in a quiet area and near the restaurants and supermarkets. Lily was very communicative and extremely helpful when I needed help during my stay.\nI was only there the one night but Lily was very friendly and helpful. I would stay again. A bit of a faff with no direct line into the city but once you work out<br\/>your bearings it\u2019s ok. Have to walk into Kings Cross to get the train which isn\u2019t the nicest area.\nThe room size was good. Enough space to put your stuff, enough hangers. Bad was good. Excess to fridge was helpfull. We did not cook, just did not feel comfortable and a lot of restaurants around.<br\/>Few things to know:<br\/>--shared bathroom (it was described). The shower did not have a curtain or anything to retain water and water is basically all over the bathroom. You need to use a mop to mop floor after taking shower because it will not dry on it's own and it will be dangerous and very slippery. We stayed in close to 30 Airbnb last few years and never ran it to something like this.<br\/>--room is very hot. Lily suggested to open window and enjoy the breeze when it was +38C outside.

Those ppl came at midnight, was talking, walking, taking shower and using hairdryer at 1 in the morning.  Disrespectful!!\nLily is Very friendly. Thanks for your warm and welcoming smile. We enjoyed yery much staying with you <br\/>Werner&Isabelle\nLily is such an amazing host! \ud83e\udd17 She kindly arranged for an early check-in, which was super helpful since I needed to work on my laptop that day. She's really friendly and a lovely person.<br\/>The room looks just like the pictures, no surprises there! Just a little heads up: the a\/c is a bit noisy, and I'm a sensitive sleeper. Plus there were a few festive folks outside making some noise too. You can definitely shut the windows, I personally love having fresh air in the room. So if you\u2019re a sensitive sleeper bringing air plugs won\u2019t be a bad idea!\nWe had a wonderful stay in Lily\u2019s apartment.

{"listing_id":6575878,"comments":"The arrangements went very smoothly and everything was great. It's a sweet home, as photographed, in a nice quiet street, and exactly what we needed as it was close to the friends we were visiting. Didn't spend a lot of time at home, but the beds were comfy, the place was very clean and well-organised, and we highly recommend it.\nMy mother and I stayed at Regina's home for 2 nights. Regina was very quick to respond to me whenever I reached out to her re: the initial reservation. The house was incredibly clean, the beds were made very nicely and both were very comfortable. A very nice home in a lovely quiet street. \nLovely cottage close to the CBD, and for our purposes on a Grand Final Weekend, ANZ Stadium. Easy access to everywhere we needed and a lovely suburb to be based in, with necessary amenities within a hundred metres. <br\/>Regina has prepared a lovely and comfortable environment for guests. Comfy bed, all the facilities you need. And a welcoming layout of coffee cups after a long trip to Sydney. The house was dressed well, fresh flowers, etc. everything laid out and welcoming. <br\/>Most importantly, especially for a Grand Final weekend, the house stay was good value. Many other providers had gone for a price gouging weekend (many unsuccessfully- with places left vacant). Regina had priced her home right. And that was a welcome relief for a busy weekend in Sydney where everyone else was trying to bleed you dry. <br\/>A great place to stay that I would thoroughly recommend. \nRegina made us feel very welcome with detailed and acurate information and  helpfull hints. The house was lovely, spotlessly clean, stylish and very comfortable.The neighbourhood  was was very quiet and very convenient to nearly everything, city centre, shops etc. Altogether we had a great stay!"}

Would stay again\nFor a great stay with all the amenities you might want Stanmore Place is one for your picks.\nVery comfortable! No complaints at all - will definitely visit again and highly recommend (especially if you have a liking for plane spotting)!\nStanmore House is spacious, clean, and great value for the area. We really appreciated all the amenities for travelling with a baby (travel cot, high chair, blinds on the windows, access to laundry facilities, separate lounge room area). Andrea was really helpful and communicative in the lead up to our stay. For travellers who aren't familiar with Sydney it is under the flightpath which can get pretty loud for kids who aren't used it to aircraft noise and not all the units are fully accessible with a pram, but it's a pretty unbeatable location for cafes, parks, restaurants and live music, and a great budget option for a stay in Sydney.\nGreat location and great place.

Good location and very helpful staff. I would definitely recommend staying here!\nBeautiful little spot for a few days stay!\nLovely place to stay, very spacious and good decor. The sun coming through the mornings was my favourite part. Although it has a secure entrance via code, the room didn\u2019t feel very secure for a solo traveller, wish the security door had a lock :( <br\/>Can be a little noisy at night through the walls. <br\/>Otherwise great location, was able to walk to multiple train lines and nice quiet street but close to amenities\nWe were delighted with Stanmore House, the service and friendliness of the staff was wonderful.

There\u2019s a really nice view from the balcony. The room was bigger than expected. Check-in and check-out were very easy - she agreed to keep our bags after check-out so we could go around the city without them. However, cleanliness didn\u2019t do it for us. Mirrors are dirty, there\u2019s dust in all corners of the rooms and although I understand that having a cat comes with having cat hair everywhere (I own 3), it could definitely be a lot cleaner than it is. The cat\u2019s litter is in the bathroom which is not a problem itself, but it could be emptied more often to avoid any smell and litter pieces on the floor which prevented us from walking barefoot in the bathroom.\n\u623f\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u5e72\u8857\u9053\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u6b65\u884c\u5230\u9c7c\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u6d77\u6e7e\uff0c\u6089\u5c3c\u5927\u6865\uff0c\u6b4c\u5267\u9662\u7b49\u3002\u697c\u4e0b\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u9910\u5385\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u98df\u7269\u591a\u3002\n\u623f\u95f4\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7edd\u4f73,\u591a\u4e2a\u666f\u70b9\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b65\u884c\u53bb\u3002\u9694\u97f3\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u53ea\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u732b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u6709\u70b9\u6389\u6bdb...\u623f\u4e1c\u4eba\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n\u516c\u5bd3\u4f4d\u4e8ecity\u7e41\u534e\u5730\u5e26\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u6e38\u73a9\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf\u3002\n\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u623f\u5b50\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f88\u8d5e\uff0c\u53bb\u54ea\u91cc\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf\u3002\nGreat quiet room with desk in a fantastic location.

The Bowling Club wasn't open while we were there but next time I'd definitely love to go there and have a meal with the locals.

It brought up my memory of using B&B 31 years ago when I came to Australia and travelled to Tasmania where we stayed with the host.  I didn't expect the continental breakfast provided to us.  It is certainly very generous of them.  We tried to explore Sydney as much as we could during the short stay, so, we were home pretty late every night.  Beverley was always there waiting for us to make sure that we got back safely.\nWe stayed twice at Beverly and Michael\u2019s with a trip to Cairns in between.

All the mod cons of an executive home and super friendly hosts.  Shops around the corner. Thanks Min\nWe had a wonderful time in this very comfy & spacious family home that made us feel at home. The views were great and the porch overlooking the view provided a beautiful breezy haven each evening for the family to congregate. We were close to Avalon town centre and were surrounded by amazing beaches. We loved our stay."}
{"listing_id":9079436,"comments":"Beautiful place, Charles was incredibly helpful too. Would definitely highly recommend\nCharles' place is great! Location is super useful and Charles is very easy to communicate with. Thanks Charles!\nCharles's apartment is quite modern and spacious for our small family (2 adults and 1 baby). The most impressive point is the big TV and sound system that my hubby and my baby enjoyed a lot.<br\/>Surry Hills was quite an area where you can find good restaurants within walking distance. There's also a small Metro Woolworths near by while Coles is a bit further up. The surrounding area is quiet so if you like something vibrant, may take some travel<br\/>Charles initiated the communication to ensure a smooth check in for us. Check out was also quite easy. <br\/>Overall it's a nice place to stay!\nGreat apartment in one of Sydney's best neighborhoods. Very close to the center of the city, just a few minutes on foot to the Central metro station, and full of cafes, restaurants, and local bars.\r<br\/>\r<br\/>Apartment was very comfortable - strong wifi, good water pressure,  and a nice balcony. Additionally, there was some great Australian art on the walls as well.\r<br\/>\r<br\/>Charles was out of town, but very responsive to any questions I had, and had good recommendations for local events and nightlife. I would definitely stay here again.\nThis is a fantastic apartment with beautiful modern decor and amazing aboriginal art work. Location is excellent with many local bars, restaurants and boutique shops on your door step.  We had a wonderful time and it was an absolute pleasure to meet Charles who  ensures you will enjoy your stay.  Thanks Charles. Noho mai rai David and Edward   \nLoved staying in Charles' place. We had a full week there, it was spacious, comfortable and in a perfect location. \r<br\/>Charles was super accommodating with everything. \r<br\/>A++ would stay again!\nOn the edge of Surry Hills by Central station, Charles' apt provided a good location between the train and the restaurants of Surry Hills. Sean (helped get us setup) and Charles were great hosts and provided everything we could have needed!\nThe stay was excellent. The host was very attentive to our queries and answered everything in a timely fashion. He even provided additional pictures to my ad-hoc request. The place is beautiful and well located. We felt at home and would love to visit again ;)\nI'm not sure I would have had a better experience staying somewhere else. The pictures on AirBnB does not do justice to this flat at all as it's soo much better in 'the flesh' so to speak, as the apartment is very modern while still feeling very homely and comfortable. The location was brilliant as well, being only a couple blocks away from Central station and in what felt like a very trendy neighborhood with lots of great places to eat and drink at nearby. Charle's friend Sean was also extremely helpful when checking me in and even provided me with advice on places I could go jogging and swimming. This experience is now my benchmark for all future AirBnB stays.\nCharles apartment is a great and cozy place. It's spacious for two. We enjoy coming back to his apartment every night. It has a big TV and great sound system with lots of programmes and CD. <br\/>Great location too as it's few minutes walk  the Central Station, many eateries and supermarket.<br\/>Highly recommended if you want all the privacy and yet the convenience.\nLovely apartment and very friendly welcome. Charles' home is beautifully furnished with very tasteful high quality items. Bed is great. Bathroom is spotless with a superb shower; large shower head and water as hot as you like. Theres a full cooker, with electric oven and gas top, and plenty of room in the fridge. They was space made for us in the wardrobe to unpack our suitcases, which we really appreciated. The whole place is well laid out, modern but warm and comfortable. To top it off its superbly located for the the central station, making both arriving from the airport and exploring super easy. We had a wonderful stay, thoroughly recommend this place, our best airbnb yet!\nWe had the most fantastic stay at Charles's flat! It's a gorgeously decorated apartment with all the amenities (including wifi and Netflix), close to the CBD and Newtown and an amazing selection of bars, restaurants and cafes in Surry Hills. Sean (who helped us check in) was exceptionally welcoming and very prompt at replying to all out enquiries. I'd highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to travel in comfort, and live like a true Sydney local.\nCharles and his friend Sean we re very nice and welcoming. They where there when I arrived and efficiently explained me how the house works as well as the main places to see in Sydney. The appartment was very nice and comfortable. Charles and Sean were very kind which is an extra nice touch!<br\/>Michel"}

A few steps in the other direction and there\u2019s a cute little street with restaurants, shops, a grocery and a pharmacy.  The beds are comfortable and the living space is spacious with plenty of seating.  The kitchen is well equipped.  A cool breeze off the water keeps the house fresh.  It was a lovely stay.\nTracy was such a thoughtful host, she even tried to find some extra items for my toddler from her friends. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!\nHad a wonderful mini-break over Easter and felt refreshed and relaxed. Tracy\u2019s home was welcoming and the location was great! Easy to get buses to Manly and from there to central Sydney by Ferry, but nice to just chill on the local beach or use the excellent ocean pool. We had all the amenities we needed and house instructions were clear and helpful. Would definitely come again.\nWe had a lovely, homely and convenient stay at Tracy & Asha\u2019s place - feels like what AirBnB was intended to be, borrowing a tidy friend\u2019s fully functioning flat for a weekend. Super convenient location, short stroll to the beach, shops and bus stop, even shorter stroll to Harbord Hotel. Had to drive to find street parking when coming and going but it was free.  Ceiling fans were a godsend on the hot summer night. Thanks!\nA lovely apartment located very close to the beach in Freshwater. Apartment had everything we needed and was spacious and bright. Close to nice cafes and supermarket as well.  Tracy was always happy to recommend places to eat out or answer any questions we had. We had a great time staying as a family of 4.\nGreat stay in Tracy\u2019s apartment. Stones throw from the beach and easy walking to Freshie\u2019s coffee shops and amenities.<br\/>Lovely clean and spacious apartment!\nThe place was sparkling clean, really comfortable, incredible location to everything. Beach, shops, parks, restaurants. Tracy was very accommodating and great to communicate with. <br\/>We were very happy with our stay, highly recommend.\nGreat location, beaches, restaurants, shops all just around the corner. The place is clean and has everything you need with comfy beds.\nThis is an excellent apartment with all the facilities you need for a comfortable stay.  Its is clean, modern and well appointed.  My wife and two children (16 and 12) were very comfortable with the girls sleeping in the 2nd bedroom with its bunk bed (single on top, large single at the bottom).  Tracy made contact at different points to check that we were settled and to check if we needed anything.  <br\/>What really stands out is the apartments location which is a very short walk to both Freshwater village with its many shops, restaurants and cafe's and the fabulous Freshwater beach.  Manly is only a walk or short bus ride away and the apartment is in an ideal location to access either the city or the northern beaches.  We hired a car and used the well connected public transport across our two week stay.  <br\/>Overall the apartment provided a great location for what was a memorable visit with family and friends at Christmas and New Year.\nWonderful home. Fantastic location so close to the beach and great food and dining options. Highly recommend!\nLoved the location!\nAmazing location. Comfy beds. Beautiful light filled apartment. Good size living spaces, helpful host - what more could you want?\nGreat spot just steps from the beach\nGorgeous sunny apartment in a wonderful location.

Small but nice apartment,  in a residential area, pretty close to Bondai beach; close to the bus stop. I recommend it to  everyone wants to enjoy life in Bondai \nCould not imagine a better place in Bondi, just a few minutes walk to the beach and Iceberg. The perfect spot and we really enjoyed the pretty appartement witch provided us everything we needed. The only downside is there are no (> 2 hours) parking spots.  We parked at the other side of the bay, near the golf club. Definately recommend! "}
{"listing_id":9944097,"comments":"Meg and Paul are warm and friendly hosts. They are helpful and kind providing a lovely home away from home for guests. They are available as much or as little as guests require and their guest bungalow is private and secure. It was a pleasure to meet Meg and Paul, and I\u2019m sure other guests would enjoy their peaceful garden retreat.\nThe accommodation is quaint and tucked away.  It has everything you need and there are some lovely touches.   For us, however, it was a little more compact and smaller than we expected.    For us Manly Wharf was too far to walk however  we  just caught an Uber one way (about $12) and a taxi the other (about $16) which wasn't a problem - and there is a good selection of public transport which is well documented by the hosts.\nClean comfortable quiet space. Good bus connection just across the road. Highly recommend.\nGood location.\nGreat little place, definitely recommend.\nA nice clean place about a 20 minute walk to main Manly beach but there is also a closer beach nearby.\nWe loved our stay in Meg\u2019s beautiful bungalow. The place is very stylish and has all you\u2019ll ever need. Also, we felt we had so much privacy, yet we could chat to Meg anytime as well :)\nNice little oasis in north Manly- close to Freshwater!\nMeg's place was charming. The space was tastefully decorated with lovely touches.  It was very comfortable, private and quite.\nPlace was great and really cosy!\nMeg was a wonderful host, very caring and attentive. We had a wonderful time playing in the sun in her garden.\nHad a great stay at the bungalow, clean and cosy, with everything you need for your stay. Good location, about a 15 minute walk to manly beach and not far from the ferries if you\u2019re planning a trip into the city\nA really lovely tucked away place to stay. Perfect for 2 people who want to be close to manly and freshwater. We really loved it. Meg was an awesome host and the garden was an absolute luxury after a very long flight!\nExcellent location, just 3 minutes walk from the bus stop, for 3 buses direct to Manly Wharf. Spotlessly clean, everything you need plus little touches to welcome guests. Would highly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in that area - perfect!!\nI booked my parents into this space whilst they were visiting from overseas. It happened to be around the corner from my apartment, which was so lucky. The hosts are amazing, I liked them very much.<br\/>My parents had a great stay and the hosts accommodated any needs around small stuff, no concerns whatsoever. There is a beautiful garden to hang out, however if you are very sensitive to noise, be aware of main street nearby.<br\/>I suggested to host to establish some storage for clothing (my parents had none) and am sure they will make those small adjustments. Thank you for sharing your space."}
{"listing_id":9965002,"comments":"Great location! Right next to Darling Harbour.\nAnnie\u2019s place was a great place to stay for our couple of days in Sydney. Location was excellent didn\u2019t need the car at all almost everything in walking distance. Car parking was a great bonus.\nAnnie\u2019s place is conveniently located for visiting central Sydney.<br\/>Pluses: <br\/>location: lots of stuff right nearby and walkable to main Sydney attractions <br\/>-price: cheaper than most hotel rooms with the added convenience of an apartment <br\/>- kitchen: We did not use much, but it seemed equipped and what we did use worked fine.<br\/>Minuses:<br\/>- a big one was bugs in the kitchen. Maybe this is always a problem in Sydney in the summer,  but was definitely a turn off<br\/>-we only stayed for one night and for such a short visit, needing to arrange to meet Annie was a little inconvenient. To be clear, she was very nice, communicative, accommodating, and met us right when she said she would, so no fault there . I just want any potential guests to know the system, since it\u2019s an extra step when you only have a short time. For a longer stay, I would not have noticed much.<br\/>-the apartment is in an older building and could use some updating <br\/>Overall it was a decent place to stay for a short visit.\nGreat location, on site parking very handy. But there were a lot of cockroaches around the kitchen sink. Which made us reluctant to cook\/eat there. A pest treatment would resolve this. Otherwise all good.\nI loved staying at Annie\u2019s. Firstly, Annie is a great host and quick to respond. The apartment is in a great central location, I mostly walked everywhere, but it was close to a tram stop for when it was a bit too hot! The flat is lovely, a lot larger than the photos suggest, and very clean. Anyone visiting Sydney, I would highly recommend here.\nWe had a great three night stay at the apartment. Meeting up with Annie to check-in was easy, and the parking spot was super helpful for the location. The apartment was comfortable, and a great location surrounded by terrific food options. Would stay again!\nAnnie was a great host, quick responses to all communications.  The unit was very clean and very well furnished, just as advertised.\nGreat for a short stay in Sydney. Walking distance from central station for a trip to the blue mountains and town hall for the tram to the harbour (or you can walk all the way). Close to plenty of shops and restaurants. Annie was a great host, from communicating after booking to meeting me on arrival.\nVery convenient near Central Station and Metro. Plenty of space for 2 people. <br\/>Unfortunately street noise on Saturday night- screeching tyres and revving cars.\nFab location, easy basement parking. Very roomy apartment. Will definitely stay here again!\nEtt perfekt boende.<br\/>L\u00e4genheten hade allt som vi f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade oss.<br\/>Annie m\u00f6tte upp oss vid ankomsten vilken var trevligt.\nThe location couldn't have been better to visit Sydney.  It was close to many attractions and public transportation.\nAwesome central location with easy onsite parking. Annie met us with the keys - easily the best check in experience ever.<br\/>And a lovely quiet apartment!!\nHighly recommend Annie\u2019s place for a weekend in Sydney, super easy to get to everything around.\nAnnie's place was very comfortable and a great location. Annie was very responsive and a great host."}

Walkable to beach, shopping, and great restaurants.\nExcellent apartment and lovely thoughtful fit out and decor.\nExcellent location so you can easily walk to the beach and cafes, very comfortable beds, surprisingly quiet being in an apartment building surrounded by apartments.\nThe apartment is well located, clean and had everything we needed for the week.\nThis Airbnb was exactly as it looks and appears in the booking. Bondi beach is so much closer that it appears - a 3 min walk at most. Loads of bars, cafes and retro's around. Communication with the host was clear and thorough meaning we had no reason to contact them at all throughout our stay. Would deffo book again.\nWell equipped flat. A couple of blocks from beach. Clean. Quiet.  Great to have aircon.\nGreat spot in a central location\nWe loved our stay here! It looks exactly as described. We particularly enjoyed the calming and comfortable balcony. The location is close to everything in Bondi. It is a very walkable area and just a short distance from the beach. The hosts were very communicative and gave us clear instructions on how to access the place. We felt safe at all times. Would recommend this place to everyone!\nWe had a great few days here! We came over for a friend\u2019s wedding and the apartment was perfect for the 4 of us that stayed. It\u2019s right in the heart of all the Bondi action and very close to the beach. Responsive hosts, very clean, highly recommend.\nThe location is great! Easy walk to the beach, cafes, supermarket and other amenities. The place is two bedroom which was plenty of space as there\u2019s so much to do in Bondi. A little room for improvement in: <br\/>- the cleanliness as the floor was dusty\/dirty<br\/>- the furniture and styling are a little tired as well and the linen is scratchy<br\/>- hotel size dishwashing liquid, shampoo etc and only 1 roll of toilet paper meant we needed to stock up on these things while we were staying (pretty annoying) <br\/>- we were denied any extension to our check out despite no-one coming into clean until the next day which felt a bit mean\nLoved my stay! Great location, very walkable to beach and stores. Really enjoyed my stay.\nSch\u00f6nes, gut ausgestattetes und ruhiges Appartment in zentraler Lage von Bondi. Mit Balkon zum begr\u00fcnten Innenhof raus. Haus wegen fehlender Hausnummer beim Check-In leider nicht ganz einfach zu finden. Kommen gerne wieder!"}

The location is perfect and the place is a peaceful haven just back from the hustle and bustle of Bondi Beach.\nWe loved staying here - a perfect homely base for a family group (or group of friends). Lovely shared living space to hang-out, as well as privacy in spacious bedrooms. Open fire in winter and outdoor garden spaces if visiting in the warmer months.\nWhat a gem of a property.<br\/>Highly recommend for Bondi stays.<br\/>Clean, central and perfect!\nBeautiful space, great location and host is super responsive. Would book again!\nSophie\u2019s place is a hidden gem. Older style but cool, eclectic and comfortable. The backyard with its water feature and fish  was very tranquil and the bungalow bedroom which opens to the yard had a Bali feel to it. Literally only 50 metres to some cafes and restaurants and an easy flat 300m walk to beautiful Bondi Beach passing the weekend Bondi markets on the way. We had one mid 30s temp day which was stifling without aircon but the ceiling fans in every bedroom and living area worked well to cool us down on the other high 20s days.  My children and I really enjoyed our stay. Sophie is a lovely host.\nThe house is beautiful and the location is perfect! We really enjoyed being such a short walk to Bondi and the coastal walk. There are plenty of restaurants, shops (including grocery and BWS) nearby. We enjoyed the courtyard and front porch and the oversized dinner table was perfect for our family to enjoy meals together and have game nights. The house does not have central air, but we were able to keep cool with fans in every room and keeping the windows open. The street does have some traffic, but nothing disturbing or unreasonable. We did not have an opportunity to meet Sophie, but she was extremely responsive, helpful, and checked in on us throughout our stay. I would recommend this place for any larger groups looking for a comfortably peaceful home walking distance to the beach!\nWe had a great time.  The house is well located with the smaller shops, cafes and restaurants 3 minutes one way, and the beach about 5 mins the other.   The house was comfortable and easy to use.  It was the hot and muggy week while we were there, but the ceiling fans were good, and you can leave all the doors open at night, and lock the grill doors, to keep the cool air in.  We had plenty of space to hang out.  Very enjoyable.\nVery helpful host! Very accommodating to our group\u2019s travel schedule. Would recommend!\ngreat location in Bondi\nCat\u2019s home is perfectly located as we could easily walk to the beach for our morning and afternoon swims or along the beautiful Sydney coastal path.

Plus, there are plenty of brunch spots around, so you\u2019ll never run out of great dining options.<br\/>However, make sure to bring some mosquito repellent if you plan to visit. There\u2019s no air conditioning, so I had to leave the windows open, but that meant getting bitten by mosquitoes all night, which made it hard to sleep. There are no fly screens on the windows, and I even had a cockroach wander in, which was a bit of a shock. The carpeted flooring feels quite dirty, almost like you can sense the traces left by all the previous guests. The room itself has sliding glass doors that don\u2019t close properly, and because of the handle hole, it\u2019s easy for people outside to see in, which really takes away from privacy.\n\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u7531\u4e8eCelia\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f88\u5fd9\uff0c\u767d\u5929\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4eab\u53d7\u6574\u4e2a\u5c4b\u5b50\u3002\u5c4b\u4e3b\u5f88\u6177\u6168\uff0c\u559c\u6b22\u8ddf\u4f60\u5206\u4eab\u665a\u9910\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\nCeila\u5f88\u53cb\u5584\u53ca\u6eab\u6696\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u6211\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u4ed6\u9084\u662f\u6703\u5f88\u6709\u8010\u5fc3\u7684\u807d\u6211\u8868\u9054\u82f1\u6587\ud83e\udd23\u623f\u9593\u4e7e\u6de8\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u5e8a\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7761\uff0c\u4e14\u623f\u6e90\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f73\uff0c\u53bb\u54ea\u88e1\u90fd\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u63a8\u85a6\uff01\nHad a wonderful time during my stay.

Fiona provided a continental breakfast each morning consisting of muesli, natural yogurt with selection of berries, honey, jam, 2 slices of sourdough bread, cafeti\u00e8re coffee and a selection of enveloped teas. I was provided with a flannel and bath towel. Towels and bed linen were changed once during my 2-week stay. If you are looking for a convenient place to stay in Sydney I would highly recommend staying with Fiona. It is located half way between Roselle and Balmain, both offering a good range of shops, restaurants and pubs. The 433 bus runs along Darling Street connecting to Railway Square at Central.\nFiona is a warm and engaging host and it was great to be back here and to be given such a friendly welcome. Balmain is a fantastic place to stay and there is an excellent Japanese restaurant only two minutes walk away where I went on Friday night. Thanks for the comfortable stay Fiona I\u2019ll be back\nI am so glad that I chose Fiona\u2019s place and that she allowed me to stay. I feel like I have made a lifetime friend. She made me feel so welcome and listened to my woeful story as to why I was staying in her area. She listened and was compassionate. I absolutely adore her and highly recommend anyone to stay with her.\nFrom arrival onwards, Fiona instantly made me feel welcomed. Her place is relaxed, and homely with the guest bedroom opening onto a private courtyard The location is extremely close to boutiques, cafes and restaurants whilst also close to nature with kookaburras adding to the community atmosphere!\nFiona's place is beautiful and really well located to the cafes and waterfront of Balmain. Fiona was a very friendly and warm host who made us feel completely at home.\nFiona was a warm and generous host. Her home is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of and the breakfasts she provides are superb! The neighbourhood she lives in in Balmain is just gorgeous. Balmain is great to walk around with plenty of cafes, pubs, restaurants, shopping and great harbourside views. Definitely recommend her place for anyone to stay.\nI loved my stay at Fiona's place and would huggly recommend it to anyone looking for a long stay in Sydney! Super cosy and Fiona is the most gracious and flexible host. Would love to stay with her again!\nFiona tried her best to let us have a  good time.<br\/>Albeit, we had the impression that using the kitchen\/washing machine was not welcome.<br\/>Recommended for a short stay.\nWe loved our stay so much and Fiona was such a perfect host! The location is perfect, so peaceful & lots of great restaurants nearby - thank you !!\nFiona is a magic host"}
{"listing_id":10574172,"comments":"Staying at Theodora's is an absolute privilege. Theodora is a wonderful host, and provided clear instructions on how to get to her place. The things I loved the most were:<br\/>1.) Theodora really cares about her guests, and is so easy to talk to. If she's home when you get home in the evening she takes the time to ask about your day and can really hold a conversation if you want to!<br\/>2.) Incredible hospitality and thoughtfulness e.g. Theodora carved out a whole space in her fridge for me to put my meal prep in for the event I was attending in Sydney, left the front door outside light on when she realised I would be getting back to hers at a late hour, etc.<br\/>3.) The room and bathroom is kept in mint condition, I couldn't be more happy. Which reminds me, I need to ask Theodora about how she keeps her taps spotless!<br\/>4.) Communication is so simple. Keys and entry are a breeze and you enter through the front door.<br\/>Do yourself a favour and stay at Theodora's, you won't regret it!\nGreat location, Theodora was very helpful and friendly.\nTheodora is a wonderful and considerate host. She made us very welcome and gave us some great local tips.<br\/>The room itself was clean and comfortable and private bathroom was just across the hallway. <br\/>If you're looking for a place in Sydney near transport, and especially close to the Olympic park precinct you couldn't do better.\nTheodora's home is absolutely beautiful, as is she. She is a gracious host and a beautiful person. I would not hesitate in recommending staying with her. I was attending a conference at Olympic Park, which is just under 15 minutes away.

The accommodation was 100% as described, near to train station and good restaurants, clean and a well equipped private bathroom. Theodora is a very welcoming host and she did everything to make sure we had not only a pleasant stay at her place but also enjoyed our city tours. We had great conversations together. I would highly recommend her place as it has both (a nice accommodation and a great host).  I will definitely visit Sydney again and one of the major point on the list would be to visit her and stay there again. \nTheodora is een hele leuke, gezellige vrouw. Ze heeft ons leuke tips gegeven en ons verblijf in Sydney zeer leuk gemaakt. De afstand naar het station is 10 min lopen en daarna ben je met de trein binnen een half uur in Sydney. Als we ooit terugkomen in Sydney zullen we zeker weer bij Theodora verblijven.\nTheodora is a wonderful host and her home is exactly as described. I stayed for business as Theodora's place is well located to get to Homebush and Olympic Park. Theodora is a wonderful host and can't do enough for you.

The location is very comfortable being close to public transport and malls. Just a few stops away from Parramatta.<br\/>Theodora was very hospitable as a host and made me feel like I was at home! More than a host she was a friend to me..<br\/>The room and bathroom are entirely self sufficient and ideal for combining work and stay (not having to bother about purchasing utilities etc)<br\/>The descrpition of the room is apt as it is indeed an \"Immaculate clean room\" although I would personally like to add to that \"a welcoming host and good location\"<br\/>Thanks so much Theodora for making me feel like home ...away from home.<br\/>No doubt this is going to be the place is stay when I come back to Sydney again.<br\/>Cheers!\nTheodora was the perfect host. An easy check in and beautiful, clean room. Theodora left us to ourselves for the most part and it was lovely to have a separate bathroom. We felt very welcomed, looked after in every aspect and had a fantastic stay.\nTheodora is a very nice host, The house is very beautiful just as the pictures showed. we are so happy to have a private bathroom, and definitely would like to recommend as 100%! Thanks Theodora!\nTheodora's house is situated in a nicely accessible neighbourhood. Lots of local eateries (Middle Eastern, Asian etc) and Auburn Station 15 mins away from the place.

Acceso desde la avenida facil\u00edsimo te dejan en la cuadra los buses que van al centro en 15 minutos. El barrio (annandale) es hermoso. Hay que salir de la avenida y doblar un poco y ya se nota. Los vecinos unos genios. A pesar de que la calle (parramatta road) es como una ruta con much\u00edsimo trafico y ruido, desde adentro no se escucha nada. A 5 cuadras hay un supermercado Coles que tiene todo. Para sacar del apuro enfrente hay un minicoles que funciona como una especie de almacen.\nI stay in this area chiefly because of the excellent bus service close by. Coffee shop Locantro one block away. Supermarket and other shops, bars a short walk away.\nThe place is next to Parramatta road-a busy road-but once you get in the compound it's tranquil. You can hear the planes, sometimes they start off quite early, but that is written in the ad, so cannot fault that.<br\/>Its very conveniently located near the bus station(1 min walk) and grocery store(10 mins walk), in case you needed to buy anything. Across the road is also this gorgeous  cafe (Pantry story) which serves amazing and exciting pastries!<br\/>The facilities are great, everything works well. <br\/>Its a short bus ride to the city. Not in the city centre, but plenty of buses and easy to get to. Would highly recommend!\nThis was my second time staying at Rebeccas AirBnB. Like last time it was well maintained and in a great location to explore sydney. It had all the necessary appliances to be self sufficient for my extended stay.

I would definitely stay here again if I am to return to Sydney.\nThe place was really lovely- it has a bus stop 30 seconds down the road that goes straight to central. Also within easy walking distance of a train station so really easy to get around. <br\/>Rebecca was so helpful and responsive when we had issues getting the tv to work-my boyfriend and I had a great time staying here for our 2 months in Sydney.<br\/>There\u2019s also nearby takeaways, restaurants, barbers, etc. and the flat was equipped with everything we needed to make our own meals. <br\/>Would totally recommend to anyone looking to stay in Sydney!\nProche de Sydney CBD, 30 mn \u00e0 pied le long de Parramatta Road, beaucoup de bus devant appartement et train \u00e0 15mn \u00e0 pied.

Manly beach is a little further away.  Bus stops are either outside the apartment or a short stroll away. Vara had set up the Christmas tree and lights as well as giving us a nice bottle of wine as a welcome gift.\nMy parents had a great stay at Varna\u2019s place. The apartment is very nice with all the essentials in a great location close to Freshwater and Manly beach. We would happily stay again.\nFantastic apartment, in a great area!  Vara's home was so wonderful for our week stay.  The area is very nice.  The northern beaches are much quieter than their busy southern counterparts.  Easy walk or public transit to cafes, shops, restaurants, and of course the beach.  Downtown Sydney\/Circular Quay just a quick ferry ride away!  Manly and Freshwater were a refreshing change after seeing the busy, crazy scene at Bondi.  Public transit is a breeze from here, with the 136 bus stopping right in front of the drive! Everything as described was provided and ready for us! Very comfortable living space.  Would definitely stay again!\nWe had a lovely time at Vara's place in Freshwater. The flat is bright, spacious and well equipped. The location is very convenient, only a few steps from shops and restaurants. It is also just a short stroll to lovely beaches. The bus stop to Manly or Dee Why is very close, too. Vara was a great host. Though we did not meet her in person, she was always easy to contact and arranged everything very nicely for us. We even had a small Christmas tree with presents underneath at the apartment when we arrived! Thank you very much!"}

Close walk to town proper and to Shelly beach. Maria was an excellent host, full of info about manly. We thoroughly enjoyed or time there.\nMaria and Jerome's place was exactly what I needed. An amazing location. I went snorkeling every day and it was just a short step out the front door and you're in the water swimming around big fish and little stingrays. It was fantastic. It was also create just to still in the window and watch people pass by as you listen to the sound of the little waves breaking. I can't wait to come back."}
{"listing_id":12454437,"comments":"The apartment was exactly what we needed. Great central location, parking in the building and nice and tidy. <br\/>Sadly the internet didn\u2019t work while we were there but Andrea was very receptive and tried to assist to help.\nConvenient location near the train station. We had a great stay. Thank you!\nThe place is in the great location and it's in a walking distance from the city centre and most Sydney's amenities. Pretty close to Redfern station which makes it's easy to get anywhere you want. The place was cleaned when we moved in and Andrea was quite helpful in terms of trying to assist with any possible issues. However, firstly the transfer of the key was quite difficult. In order to get the key, we travelled to a different suburb. It wasn't a big problem for me since I have been in Sydney already and I know city central but it might be extremely confusing for someone who has just arrived. Secondly, when we entered a unit we found fridge leaking. I immediately informed Andrea about that. Although I should admit she tried her best to get it fixed, we stayed for a week and fridge still hasn't been fixed. Thirdly, in terms of cleanness, we found someone's underwear in the safe which was quite unpleasant.<br\/>Overall, if it's a business trip and your main priority is being close to the city centre, the place suits you. In the case of a family trip with kids, I wouldn't advise you go there.\nNice.\nGreat place and suitable for family, quiet, close to amenities.\nwell located,clean but a little traffic noise \nThis place is in an amazing location. Close to shops, restaurants and public transport. Plus only a short walk to the city. Apartment was clean and comfortable for a couple to stay in. Good for long or shorter weekend stays. Andrea was easy to deal with and easily reachable.<br\/>Would definitely stay here again when we're in Sydney.\nNice and clean place. It met expectations."}

{"listing_id":14239164,"comments":"Great studio apartment. We were only there two nights but it was great for us to wander around sydney. You can walk down to Lunar Park in about 20 minutes, and from there catch the ferry to Central Quay. Great cafes nearby for breakfast in the morning. <br\/>Jean Claude have very clear descriptions on how to get in and replied very quickly to the questions I had. <br\/>Great space for a couple as a base to go around the city!\nMaybe my favorite Airbnb ever. The unit itself was terrific and spacious, and had everything I needed, with a nice outdoor sitting area. The location really worked for me. It's super easy and quick to get there from the harbour and other parts of Sydney (and easy taking the metro\/train to Sydney airport, even with my big suitcase and bike bag). But it's quieter and felt like a really nice getaway from the hustle of Sydney, and there were great places to eat (The Library, Vento) nearby. Finally, Jean-Claude and Peggy were extremely responsive. I asked Jean-Claude about getting an Amazon order because I forgot a cable. He gave me the information I needed and - own his own - found a local store to buy what I needed. I don't recommend this, but I locked myself out. Peggy was there within 10 minutes to let me in. All in all, a GREAT experience.\nNice and quiet spot. Easy to get around. The apartment has everything you need to get some rest after a day in the city. Hosts respond very quick.\nExcellent location, close to metro and the huddle of N Sydney but a lovely quiet place right across from the park.<br\/>Perfect place to stay for a work trip and also extended stays.<br\/>Will stay again and highly recommend it to others.<br\/>JeanClaude is a really proactive and helpful host, feel supported from first email to check out.\nWe had a nice and comfortable stay at JeanClaude's apartment. The place was clean and well-maintained. The host was always responsive and was there to help.\nA fabulous stay in a great location and close to all forms of transport. The studio was bright and airy and looked out on a beautiful park for great morning walks. Very clean and comfortable. Great cafes nearby.\nThe place was really lovely and not too far from the metro. Thanks!\n.\nLove the space! It exceeded our expectations!\nJean-Claude & Peggy were nothing short of amazing and made our stay so smooth & easy ! We can\u2019t thank them enough! The place itself was absolutely perfect and had everything we needed in such a cute place!\nI spent 4 weeks in this place and found it very enjoyable every day in my stay.<br\/>I urgently request Jean for reschedule due to urgent family matters and he fully understand my situation and didn't apply extra charge - what a considerate host!<br\/>Regarding the studio, it's incredibly spacious (sufficient for a small family's stay) with full functioning kitchen makes my cooking super easy. Surrounded by St Leonards park, various cafe, library and grocery stores make my daily life so convenient while I can still enjoy the tranquility in the late evening. Will definitely consider revisit.\nLovely apartment, across from a park. Can easily walk everywhere in North Sydney!\nI stayed for 3 months in this AirBnb and I just loved it. Nothing to react on. In line with all the other comments, it is just perfect. Clean, cozy, close to public transport and absolutely amazing you have the park in front of you. The hosts responded really fast to my questions and made sure I had all of the comfort they could offer. Would definitely return to this one in the future.\nExcellent location, very clean and functional with nice touches (including for our toddler - cot, high chair, baby bath), and Jean Claude was great to deal with. Recommend.\nI chose JeanClaudes airbnb to celebrate my girlfriends birthday & it was the best decision. We didn\u2019t have a vehicle, so it worked out perfectly with everything we wanted to do being in walking distance. We\u2019re very picky on cleanliness & this place was spotless. Our hosts were extremely kind & had written my girlfriend a birthday card also! We would definitely come back here again :)"}

{"listing_id":14775432,"comments":"We loved staying at Rod's place. A beautifully designed home where we felt right at home. Rod was super responsive with communication and gave some good local recommendations!\nRod was very quick to respond to my questions and offered great recommendations for things we wanted to do in the area.  The house was perfect for our group of five adults.  We enjoyed sitting on the kitchen patio (one of three available) for coffee\/tea, dinner, and playing cards.  Only thing that would have made this accommodation nicer would have been air conditioning.  Thank you, Rod, for being such a gracious host!\nOne word -eclectic.  This is Rod\u2019s home that he makes available to renters.  So all of his belongings are in the house.  He puts things away and makes room in closets but it\u2019s just very different from anywhere I have ever stayed.  He is a super nice guy and met us in person when we got there and took the time to make suggestions of things to do while we were in Sydney.  The neighborhood was fine.  Walking distance to groceries but not many restaurants right in the vicinity.  The best thing was the Fruitalicious a\u00e7a\u00ed cafe and grocery store - amazing!!!!  All in all we had a good stay.  His house is FULL of eclectic stuff and if you are into that you will enjoy it.  The beds were comfortable but the other furniture is old and basic.  We had a great time in Sydney!  Thanks Rod!\nAmazing location! Rod\u2019s place is perfectly situated for trips to the city, ferry rides or just to explore the excellent surrounding neighbourhood, cafes and attractions. The house is very well equipped and wi-fi was fast - although there\u2019s no TV.  We particularly appreciated how clean the house was, the abundance of fresh towels and the excellent bathroom. And, of course, all the fascinating treasures around the house to enjoy thinking about. The beds were also lovely and comfy. Our group of six did, however struggle without a dining table big enough for a group meal - but with so many great restaurants to eat on your doorstep you may not need one!\nWonderful location and lovely host. Stairs difficult <br\/> for the elderly or those with mobility issues but it suited our trip really well.\nRod\u2019s place is bursting with character, colour and careful touches - such a unique, and special place. Also, the location is amazing. The light and beautiful surrounding vegetation on the upstairs balcony as the evening draws is something I\u2019ll never forget - likewise the vibe of Rozelle & Rod\u2019s place: we had a memorable, highly enjoyable stay.\nWonderful house in a great part of Sydney.\nRod is such a great host! He was very accommodating m, helping me set up a surprise for my partner and his home is beautiful. The decor is amazingly selected and the old home feel of the house was just sublime. Location is excellent with many cafes and restaurants a within short stroll and Sydney CBD only a short cab ride. My partner and I highly recommend staying here we loved it!\nFantastic location, great restaurants , cafes, shops and public transport all walking distance. Rod has a wonderfully eclectic home.\nRod\u2019s Terrace House in Rozelle is a lovely place to stay, really spacious, clean and wonderfully located in a quiet residential area.  It is very close to great cafes and eating places, with beautiful scenic walks around the historic Rozelle and Harbour.  As a host, Rod is the best!  He is extremely kind, thoughtful and understanding.  Rod made my family\u2019s stay in Sydney to attend my brother\u2019s funeral as easy as possible, making sure we had everything we needed, and being flexible with the uncertainty of numbers etc.  We felt we had a home base during a difficult time, thank you Rod, we hope to meet you again one day.  We thoroughly recommend Rod\u2019s beautiful Terrace House to other guests:)\nRod has a beautiful home, a spacious, thoughtful area filled with his incredible design aesthetic, open courtyard and balconies in the heart of the city. He opened his home to us at a time of great need at a moment's notice and we will always be grateful for the time we spent there.\nRod was a great host, nothing was too much trouble and his responses were immediate and helpful.. the house is big, full of interesting art put together in a tasteful way.. the location is also good, just around the corner from a street full of restaurants and great shops..loved the area..\nRod was a fantastic host. Went above and beyond to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The house is  awesome and the \"80 days around the world\" touches add a charming character to the place. Plenty of spaces to sit and relax including the garden and patio\/breakfast area. <br\/>Situated in a quiet neighborhood, although very easy to get to from the CBD.\nOur family of four was new to Sydney and Rod's house was in the perfect location to explore during the summer holidays. The house is in near Darling Street with a wide range of bars, caf\u00e9s and shops and also close to transport links and the waterfront (Dawn Fraser Baths are nearby).  The house itself is unique, with beautiful period features, plants, interesting antiques and artwork and a wide range of books and magazines. We enjoyed being outside in the gardens and particularly the balcony. The bedrooms were all imaginatively and tastefully decorated and very comfortable with plenty of storage space for our 8 week stay. Rod was very helpful giving us tips about where to view the New Year fireworks and also about the Sydney Festival, which we fully utilised.\nOur group of four had a great stay in Rods wonderful terrace conveniently located in Rozelle close to shops, bars, restaurants and public transport. <br\/>Rod was a great host and has lots of information on hand to make your stay in Rozelle a memorable one.  The house is full of Rods travels with many collective items on show that spark many conversation about their origins? <br\/>The terrace house is clean with comfy beds with lots of light streaming though the front bedroom windows. The gardens are a tranquil delight and a must adventure with a glass of wine in hand.<br\/>Sadly we didn't get to meet Rod but hope to on our next trip?<br\/>"}

Everything was top notch and easy. Patrick was very responsive and the little gift hamper was very appreciated.\nHet appartement van Patrick en Andy voldeed volledig aan onze verwachtingen. Het is een heerlijk, comfortabel, gezellig appartement. Alles wat je nodig hebt is aanwezig. Heerlijk bed, fijne douche. En heel rustig. <br\/>De buurt is fijn, vooral restaurant Foodcraft op de hoek. Een aanrader.<br\/>Wat ook erg handig is , is de nabijheid van het openbaar vervoer. En Sydney Park is vlakbij. Kortom, ga je naar Sydney kies dan voor dit appartement.\nPatrick\u2019s apartment was the perfect spot for me, a solo traveler in Sydney wanting to be in the inner west. He made me feel so welcome and treated me like a friend. The apartment was very cute and clean, near a great coffee shop and public transportation. I will definitely stay there again when I return to Sydney!\nPatrick was a good host. It was great that he came and welcomed us at the door \ufffc - even with our air flight delay. He surprised us with a welcome basket. \ufffc\ufffc His place had all the modern conveniences \ufffcneeded for a pleasurable holiday. We would try to book Patrick\u2019s place again the next time we visit Australia.\nFirst of all: This place and its host deserve 6 stars, seriously! The apartment location in beautiful Erko is perfect to discover this sweet little suburb, plus it is just a beautiful stroll to quirky Newtown, which I love! As well the train is a 7 minutes walk away and it takes you into CBD, Opera House and all central locations within 15 minutes.<br\/>The apartment itself is a beauty: very tastefully furnished and decorated, spotlessly  clean, kitchen well equipped, has a washing machine and dryer as well. And the bed is fantastic, slept like a baby. Beautiful big balcony to the very green and quiet patio of the apartment complex, so it is very quiet all the time, especially at night. As I woman I felt super safe at any time. Patrick couldn't have been a better host, he was super kind all the time, very helpful and always responded quickly to every question. Seriously one of the best Airbnb's I have ever been to. Will surely be back!!!\nPatrick was the best host. From the clear communications, pristine apartment and thoughtful welcoming touches. Would definitely stay again, it felt like a hotel but also so homely!\nGreat location to get into town with the Erskinevile train a short walk from the flat. Has lovely restaurants and bars within walking distance in new town and Erskinevile. They have a very local coffee shop and restaurant called foodcraft which is excellent. The apartment is spotless with high spec appliances and they very kindly stocked the place with things that we could use. I would highly recommend staying there.\nAnother great stay at Patrick's!  A beautiful home in a great, convenient location.  Patrick is a great host:  excellent communication, responsive, and he makes sure his home is well stocked, clean and welcoming.

His place is pristine, well-appointed and furnished, quiet and conveniently located.  Restaurants, coffee shops, bars, shopping, mass transit and entertainment are all within walking distance.  Patrick's communication is swift and complete and he was there to check me in even after a significant flight delay.  A five star experience all around!\nI thoroughly enjoyed staying at Patrick's place for the 5 weeks I was there.  Not only did he meet me in person to give me a tour and the keys, but all the little extras that were left for me - champagne, butter, eggs, and chocolate, to just name a few - made me feel very welcome and right at home. His place is so comfortable and has all the creature comforts of a home away from home.  The deck was so lovely to sit out on and listen to the birds sing, enjoy the peaceful space, and feel very private.  I was so comfortable there that I hated leaving!  I will definitely check in with you when I return to Sydney in the future.\nHighly recommend for proximity to Newtown and having driven up fromMelbourne the M8 practically took us to the door. Sydney Park nearby is lovely.\nThis was our second stay at Patrick\u2019s place. We love the location just outside the city but a short train ride away and a short walk from the bustling Newtown. The apartment was perfect for our holiday and Patrick has been so helpful and easy to communicate with even from over in the uk!"}

I stayed in her house for 2 months and didn't miss anything.  <br\/>So I want to say: Thank you Michelle and I hope we see us again:-)\nWas a great stay\nMichelle's house is situated in an exceptional location, with convenient access to the train station, market, and restaurants. The spacious room boasted a comfy bed, ensuring a restful stay. Michelle's dedication to cleanliness was evident throughout the house, maintaining impeccable cleanliness standards. Her responsiveness and flexibility regarding check-in and check-out times were greatly appreciated. <br\/>While there was a minor incident where someone entered in the room in our absence, Michelle's hospitality and the overall positive experience prompted a 5 star rating.

Excellent communication from Tanya and flexible with arrival & departure times was greatly appreciated. Excellent hosts and would highly recommend. Thank you\nWe had a wonderful stay at Tanya and Brad\u2019s home in Rose Bay \/ North Bondi. The house was perfect for our family group and fantastically equipped. We really appreciated how much effort Tanya and Brad had gone to to move their belongings to create space for us eg wardrobes, pantry space etc. The pool was a particular favourite with our kids and the laundry room with washer, dryer, and drying rack was very welcome at the end of a long trip.\nTanya's and Brad's house is very spacious and comfortable. <br\/>It is their home and they look after it very well.

{"listing_id":16259821,"comments":"The view was stunning when we walked in, just like the photo\u2019s. love the location straight down to freshwater Beach and a walk into Manly. The place was beautifully set up, quality furnishings and great care to make sure we had everything needed for the stay. On top of that Julie was so easy to communicate with and clearly takes great care of her guests. Fabulous stay \u2026 10 out of 10\nStunning view and everything you would want in a summer vacay stay on the northern beaches. The views, are STUNNING both during the day and night and it's super relaxing and has beautifully appointed interiors. The garage access is right at the door step of the entrance (I managed to squeeze in a 4WD)  and being on the top floor meant no noise from the neighbours above your floor. Speaking of neighbours,...they are the friendliest Aussies you'll meet. Thank you Julie for going above and beyond to make our stay wonderful and relaxing.\nWe absolutely loved the apartment and the location. Very clean and airy with fabulous views of Freshwater Beach. Nice furnishings and felt very at home.  The balcony is a great place to sit and read watching the continuous stream of surfers.<br\/>Manly is a short walk and lots to offer. The steps down and up both to and from Freshwater and Manly certainly keep you fit ! <br\/>Would love to come back\nfantastic stay, excellent view of the beach!\nI would highly recommend this airbnb. The views were amazing and the home truly was exceptional. My family and I very much enjoyed our stay here. Julie was such an amazing and thoughtful host. She would reply very fast and accommodated our inquiries. If you are planning to stay somewhere near manly or northern beaches, I highly would recommend staying here. I hope to come back soon.\nJulie is the ultimate host, and her apartment is absolutely amazing. Before booking I read all the positive reviews which was comforting, so we went in with high expectations, but I can easily say that our stay surpassed these expectations. The location is great. The views are amazing, especially to wake up to. Julie has thought of everything. I can\u2019t recommend this place high enough, and I will definitely look to book and stay again\nI didn\u2019t want to leave! Julie has a wonderful gem of an apartment in the best location- ever. I\u2019m pretty sure it has the best views in all of queenscliff\/freshwater. From sunrise to sunset the view makes it hard to even walk out the door. Julie was lovely and easy to communicate with and the apartment is well stocked and had everything we needed. Will definitely return, thank you!\nBeautiful apartment overlooking Freshwater beach. We will be booking again!\nMy family and I travelled to Australia visiting our Aussie family who live local to Julie\u2019s place, so this was the perfect crash pad for us. The apartment was immaculately clean and beautifully kept - lovely and modern, very comfortable and even had a little alcove with a desk space, which was super handy for my boyfriend who had to login for some late-night lectures during our trip. The shower was amazing (one of those waterfall-type showers) and the beds super comfy BUT the best part was the absolutely insane views out over Freshwater beach - I could have sat there all day and watched the surfers ride the waves. Highly recommended and will no doubt stay again on the next family trip! Thanks Julie for a wonderful stay :)\nThe accommodation was so clean and well appointed. comfortable beds, open space living area. It felt like home as soon as we arrived.<br\/>There were plenty of ideas where to eat and leaflets on things to do. Julie was so helpful - nothing was too much trouble.  Freshwater beach gave us such a beautiful view every morning.<br\/>The restaurants in Manly would cater for anyone\u2019s tastes and Uber taxis were easy to access for journeys home if we needed one. <br\/>Wonderful.\nThis beautiful flat comes with the highest and best view in all of the Freshwater area--way above the birds--where the sun and the moon seem to rise right out of the ocean.  It looks down onto wonderful Freshie beach and is close walking distance to all the amenities of both Freshie and Manly.  We spent hours on the balcony watching the Christmas festivities, and enjoyed cooking in the well-appointed kitchen and having family dinners at the dining table.  The bedrooms are very comfortable and quiet, located at the back of the apartment, and the separated shower and half-bath were a great feature. Julie thought of everything we needed and was a great communicator whenever we had any questions.  We can't wait for our next visit!\nAmazing views, amazing place, amazing host!\nThis is a spectacular spot with views that are unbelievable.  You get both sunrise and sunset.  The place is modern, stylish and immaculately kept.  And Julie was wonderful.  We\u2019ll stay here again!  Recommend enthusiastically.\nGreat spot, spectacular views, easy walk to everything needed in the area. Very quiet in the evenings. Apartment is well decorated and thought out. Very comfortable in general. Julie is a good host\nThis is a beautiful apartment. The location is amazing. Top floor, wrap around balcony, on the hill crest overlooking Freshwater beach. You won\u2019t find a better view of this beach. The apartment is recently remodeled with stylish finishes and designer touches. Julie is a thoughtful host.

It is a beautiful apartment in a fantastic location - great for exploring Paddo and with easy transport links to the CBD and Bondi\/Bronte etc.   The apartment is large and bright, and is both comfortable and very stylishly furnished.  Add to that, Mischa was a great host -  very proactive and helpful.  We would definitely like to stay here again next time we are in Sydney.\nThis home was amazing! Centrally located, we walked almost everywhere! Great restaurants nearby, friendly people, just a delight. What topped off everything was the guide Mischa\u2019s provided, complete with restaurant recommendations (he was spot on with his suggestions) and everything we might want\/need to know to get the most out of our stay. I would book this home again.\nWhere do I start with Mischa\u2019s place \ud83d\ude42 Let\u2019s start by saying 5* on ALL. Communications with Mischa was prime time. Extremely clean with all amenities. The appartment itself is a jewel and has everything you can hope for. Nice terrace with a BBQ. Super comfy beds and very nice bathrooms. The neighbourhood, well it\u2019s Paddington. You simply have a great vibe. Walkable everywhere and really safe. Full of bars and good restaurants right on Oxford. One kilometer from Centennial Park, a must\u2026 One minute from bus 333 that goes to the Customs House. (14 minutes bus ride) Custom House is a great place to start walking around. The Rock is  is real close. The Customs House is 3 minutes walk to the Manly Beach ferry.  Well worth the trip to Manly Beach if just to experience the Opera House and Harbour Bridge on water. I highly recommend Mischa place.\nFantastic apartment, beautiful furniture with everything you could need for a wonderful stay. Mischa was a friendly, responsive host, highly recommend!\nCheck-in was a bit tricky, but I appreciated the strict security.<br\/>When I arrived, the elevator and Wi-Fi were not working, so I had to contact the host and find a solution, which took some time. However, the room itself was very clean.<br\/>Due to yard construction, workers were passing by the window from the morning, so I couldn\u2019t raise the blinds. Please keep this in mind.\nWe love this beautiful house! The location is very convenient with 2 mins walk to 333 bus stop which could be connected to most destinations in Sydney. The house is very clean and I love the kitchen best! Will definitely go back here next time!\nWe had a fabulous time. Everything in the apartment was perfect, really comfortable and clean and everything was really well explained.<br\/>We couldn't ask for a better location, great to be able to walk everywhere (Centennial Park, the City, Moore Park, the Markets, out for dinner etc).  Nice and close to the beaches and the city at the same time.<br\/>Thank you!\nMischa's place was incredible! We had everything we needed and more. So comfy, clean and spacious. We loved our stay and would definitely go back!\nThe place was fully stocked and easy to find for public transportation drop off and pick up (we were in town visiting family from every corner of the city). We loved our morning and evening walks through the parks. It was a highlight of our trip.\nI felt very lucky to discover Mischas\u2019 home online. As a past Paddington resident I knew the location was perfect and for the price he was asking, totally reasonable. <br\/>The pictures are absolutely accurate- modern, very clean, functional, didn\u2019t want for anything. I found his home extremely quiet and peaceful.<br\/>He was extremely responsive and courteous, and I could tell he really loved his home and appreciated others enjoying it fully. <br\/>When I come back to Sydney next time I will definitely work around the availability of his property as it really was the perfect AIRBNB - if not my favorite I have ever stayed at. <br\/>5 ***** \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\nBeautiful accomodation!

{"listing_id":17388272,"comments":"Fabulous location, the studio had everything we needed for our 4 week stay and we loved sitting on the balcony watching the world go by. Catherine was very helpful - highly recommend.\nWould highly recommend Catherine\u2019s place if you need somewhere to stay in Sydney. Location is brilliant, literally a 1 minute walk from Central Station where you can get buses, trains or trams. Also, plenty of places within walking distance. Catherine is friendly and responsive.\nFantastic location for a short city stay. Fantastic to have a good kitchen and laundry.\nCatherine cordially greeted us at 10 am to show the lodging and give us tips on what to do in Sydney. The 320 square-foot (plus balcony) exceptionally well- stocked and clean studio apartment is located on the second floor of an older building right at the central transportation hub. We muffled early morning honking and door slamming with white noise so we slept very well in the comfy 62 inch wide bed. WiFi download speed was 0.2 to 28 Mbps depending on the variable internet provider service. We did not use the clothes dryer because the hot wet exhaust air exits into the apartment. Unlike most rentals, this apartment has a warm, spongy carpeted floor. Plenty of real hot water. More than 50 clear cable TV channels.\nA lovely studio apartment in an ideal location next to Central station with multiple options for getting around and out of Sydney. Despite the central location the apartment was quiet and comfortable.\nGreat place to stay! <br\/>Clean, accessible and reasonably quiet considering the central location. <br\/>Would certainly come back.\nCatherine is responsive and very friendly, she\u2019s always willing to offer help. And the apartment is nice and the location is close to central station, which is convenient, we had a nice stay in Sydney!\nThe location is great, just a 5-minute walk from Central Station. There are also buses and light rail nearby, making it very convenient to get around. Catherine will greet you upon check-in. She is very willing to assist with any questions, making it a very pleasant stay.\nTwo things made this the best accommodation for us. <br\/>Ease of transport with the Light Rail and Train Station very close by and how accommodating the host made us feel. Our flight was delayed and very late and the host met us with a bright and cheery smile. <br\/>Would stay again.\nThank you to Catherine for being such a responsive, friendly and flexible host, allowing us to check in early and to leave later. Any issues were dealt with immediately.\nThis is a very well equipped studio flat with everything we needed for a month\u2019s stay. It is a central location with easy access to downtown and the Opera House area. Being next to Central station gives you very ready access to other parts of Sydney and beyond such as the Blue Mountains. Inevitably given its location there is some traffic noise but this is cut out by the double glazed balcony doors. Catherine was a very friendly and helpful host. Would definitely recommend staying here.\nGreat place, perfect location. Overall we had a great stay \ud83d\ude0a\nExcellent location near central station for getting around Sydney , and Catherine was very welcoming and responsive. Although the apt was clean , the decoration was a little tired and immediate area and view from balcony was not great.  Good value .\nExcellent apartment, great location, great transport links to everywhere! Highly recommend it, hopefully wont be long until the lift is back in operation \ud83e\udd75\nCentrally located studio, close to amenities and public transport. Has everything you need for a city stay. Building and studio are both quiet, however the balcony overlooks the road."}

Jo was a great host, always attentive, helpful and super responsive. We loved our time there, so many thanks Jo for everything!\nJo has been super helpful. Her place is lovely with her family photos which made us feel at home too. The little greeting card was heartwarming. We liked that the house is clean and tidy, with almost everything we needed. She has been responsive and offered help whenever we needed it.\nWe had a wonderful stay at Jo's place. It was perfect for our family of 5, spacious, clean, great location and everything Jo said it was. An amazing host. Thank you Jo, would come again in a heartbeat!\nAn absolutely beautiful home. A quiet oasis. Perfect for our needs. Thank you Jo.\nThis was our second stay and we absolutely loved it, if not more than our first time. The house is gorgeous, well-kept, beautifully decorated and furnished, clean and spacious. The backyard is wonderfully done aesthetically, and we had many nice breakfasts basking in the sun amid greenery, and evening drinks there. The house is super well-equipped from kitchen needs to even toys and games for our kids. This truly felt like a home away from home.<br\/>The location of Lane Cove West is super central to everything Sydney has to offer, a mere 15 min to no more than 30 min to CBD, beaches, famous Sydney attractions like the zoo and more. In addition, Lane Cove West is such a nice serene and welcoming community - there is a beautiful vintage like mall nearby with 3 big supermarkets, bookstores, toy shops and lots of restaurants; and a new and incredible children\u2019s playground atop the mall. <br\/>Jo is an absolutely perfect host, being incredibly responsive, thoughtful and friendly. 100% star host!!\nExcellent host, great communication and prompt responses. The residence is beautiful, spacey and very well maintained.<br\/>Would highly recommend if travelling to Sydney.\nJo\u2019s house is beautiful and very spacious. We had a fantastic stay. Jo was very helpful and responsive. Thanks for the great home base whilst in Sydney.\nWe stayed for a multigeneration family holiday. The house was perfect for this with its enormous living areas and separate spaces. The place had everything we needed and Jo was very easy to coordinate with. We didn\u2019t have a car and walked everywhere which we found very doable. Would highly recommend Jo and her home for your next holiday.\nWas exactly like the ad said very family friendly home . Very clean and everything that you need to feel comfortable. Will def come here again!! Jo was amazing!!\nLarge, practical home. Excellent for sharing with kids. Gorgeous garden with deck for relaxing and entertaining. <br\/>Surrounded by tall trees, nearby sporting grounds, tennis courts and off lead dog park - all along Lane Cove River. Surprising bush escape in the middle of suburban Sydney. <br\/>Walk in the nearby reserve to a bench with views was my daily must do activity.\nGreat Place to stay. Everything works as detailed on the property advert. Great location and close to everything.\nA good place to stay for our first trip at Sydney. Great service and nice place. Highly recommended \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29\nJo's place was wonderful. It was well equipped, spacious, quiet, clean and comfortable.  Lovely to come back to each evening! Jo was prompt and friendly in her communications as a host. I would recommend it to a family or groups of friends travelling together. Thank you Jo!\nLovely house, we all enjoyed our stay here.\nThis is a place I would recommend for family guests - the house is nice and clean, the garden is great and the neighborhood is excellent. There is a close by playground for the kids (within 5 min walking distance) and we had been there a few times and the kids were never tired of it.<br\/>The kitchen is well equipped and big. The place is clean with aircon so perfect for winter or summer time. There is a washing machine and dryer, and plenty of space to hang your clothes if you want to.<br\/>The host had been very accommodative to our check-in and check-out time. <br\/>My family had enjoy our 2 weeks stay and wishes to come back in the future.<br\/>If you have a car, the location of the house is in the middle of many places, if you don\u2019t have a car, traveling will be challenging as the suburb does not have train (but has bus)."}

{"listing_id":17883329,"comments":"My Granddaughter is crawling and we asked Ween to arrange another clean of the lounge and kitchen areas.  Ween responded quickly to our request.<br\/>The property is lovely and we were sad to leave it. A real home from home xxx\nGreat place, great location, and great host. Great for a family. They were very responsive and great hosts. Walkable to beach and train. Highly recommend.\nThe house is in a great location and has wonderful views from the top bedroom. We were delighted to be able to access the house a little earlier than the agreed time for check in and the instructions on finding and getting into the house were perfect. It was really easy to get around from the house to other parts of Sydney and the street is lovely and quiet. Unfortunately, it was too cold to dip our toes into the pool, but it looked inviting.<br\/>The house felt a little tired and in need of a little TLC. Some of the lights didn't work, including in the stairwell and when mentioned to the owner on the first day, this wasn't fixed and made the stairs tricky to navigate at night. There was a post-it note saying \"fix\" on the door to one of the bathrooms which made us unsure if we could shut the door. The windows in the top room are very draughty and don't shut properly and the blind has an enormous stain on it. The house also lacked some of the essential things like washing up liquid.\nWe had a great time, location was great and we were given easy instructions \ud83d\ude42\nThe house is in a good location and very charming . The carpet was stained  and smelled old dust. its a great place but needs to be cleaned deeply\nWe were grateful to find an Airbnb to stay with our dog, Ajax. It was conveniently located to shops and the park. The house itself was unrenovated, but it was perfectly comfortable and everything is in working order. The pool was great for the kids on hot days. Thank you for having us to stay.\nUse the location to walk to the beach and to the shops because we found parking a bit costly it was the first time using Airbnb and I was happy with the space for the price we paid. That\u2019s why I wanted to try and Airbnb and I will now use it in the future. I recommend Bronti beach if you have kids there is a safe area one end it was fantastic\nGreat location and a big house but it\u2019s just not worth the money. So much stuff needs fixing in this house. <br\/>Stained carpets, filthy windows, pool needed cleaning when we arrived. <br\/>Ween is a responsive host but there were so many issues that we just shouldn\u2019t have had to get sorted: no hairdryer; electric plug socket hanging out of the wall; broken lock on sliding door; only two wine glasses and one champagne glass. The list goes on\u2026\u2026.\nWe hebben een heerlijk verblijf gehad in het huis. In de basis is alles voldoende schoon, zoals de bedden, de badkamers en de keuken. Maar het lijkt alsof alle randjes en hoekjes nooit schoongemaakt worden. Raamkozijnen waren stoffig, het terras was niet aangeveegd, er lagen bladeren en zand in het zwembad toen we aankwamen en de algemene staat van onderhoud van het huis zou ik redelijk noemen. <br\/>Twee van de tuinstoelen bleken kapot bij aankomst, ik heb toen een bericht gestuurd naar de host en die heeft dat de volgende dag vervangen, dat was erg netjes en snel. <br\/>Al met al is het een fijn en ruim huis en hebben we genoten van ons verblijf, maar het was prettiger geweest als het huis wat schoner was geweest.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ween's home.  The location is fantastic and so close to great restaurants and beaches.  Communication and check in was efficient and easy.  We were a family group so the space and pool were a bonus.  We would definitely stay here again.\nOk house, good location , but in need of some renovations, which I believe they are doing in between let\u2019s .\nThis is a beautiful and homely place to stay! The beds are really comfortable, and the kids absolutely loved the pool!<br\/>As everyone else mentions, parking can be tricky, but we generally managed to find available spots on surrounding streets.<br\/>I'd definitely stay here again!\nWould recommend reading others comments before booking. The location and prompt communication of host were great. Unfortunately the place is much more run down than pictured, the carpets are filthy and there was a general sense of uncleanliness which simply doesn't match the price point - particularly the hefty cleaning fee.\ncommunication and adaptability with host cannot be faulted. the codes and pictures on the app are not updated so pay attention to the email you recieve. the home is more run down than what the pictures have you believe.\nThis is the second time we have stayed at Abdullah\u2019s place and overall we have a great experience. <br\/>With a couple of small tweaks this could be a great stay. <br\/>We had a couple of problems in our stay, a high chair was covered in mould and next to outside bins but after letting Abdullah know, a brand new high chair arrived the next day. <br\/>The fridge also stopped working but again, a repair person was there the next day. Unfortunately it couldn\u2019t be fixed and we had to throw out all of our food. But I appreciated that he tried to resolve it quickly. <br\/>If you are driving please be aware the car space only fits a tiny car. The house is on the same street as a primary school and there is a sports oval at the end of the street so there is a constant flow of traffic and parking is almost impossible most of the time. <br\/>If you have a baby (like us) please also be aware there is a dog in the neighbouring the house that barks ALL day. He woke our baby up more than once. <br\/>What we love - the location is close to everything. Walk to the beach or to the big shopping centre in bondi junction. The bedrooms and bathrooms are really nice too."}

The property has a querky Bundeena-style Fibro 'shack' atop a sandstone outcrop, shaded by a sprawling Angaphora Red gum tree, with panoramic vistas of Port Hacking through the leaves. Inside the shack is a luxurious queen sized bed, a pebble floored wetroom, kitchenette and a dining area that takes in the view. There's a deck and a hot tub too. there's everything you need there for a longer stay and Lee lives in the big house further up the property if you need help etc. Location is good, less than 10 minutes walk to the shops, cafes,  Social Club and Gunyah and Jibbon beach. All Good.\nGreat Location!<br\/>Close to beautiful beaches and all of the things Bundeena has to offer.Very peaceful spot.Loved the Spa and would love to stay again!\nCute little place and great location\nGreat place!

The check in instructions were also very detailed.  However, it's important to be aware that the listing is for a student housing unit. Additonally, when asked about availibility for parking, the hosts took a month to answer the question and waited until the day before our booking to provide an answer. There is very limited street parking and overnight paid parking garages are not close to the listing.  The room was not air conditioned and the portable A\/C mentioned in the check-in instructions was no where to be found. There was only a small fan located on the upstairs portion near the bed. It was alright for a one night stay and was close to the airport however, I'd strongly advise to reconsider if driving in.\nHost was very friendly and responsive. We also got clear instructions with photos on how to enter the property.\nGreat location for uni and shops, beautifully decorated and a lovely cozy space.

The house was cleaned the best they could but there was still a strong cigarette smell that lingered.\nAwesome host <br\/>Will come again !\nOverall, I had a comfortable stay at this apartment. I particularly liked the location (right next to the St Leonard\u2019s train station), this made it very convenient for me to hop on a train and travel to the city. The apartment was a good size for up to 2 guests. The photos shown was of a newer apartment, so that was my expectation. However, the apartment that I stayed in was older and more dated. The cupboard in the bathroom was quite run down and the carpet in the lounge room looked dirty. Other than that, everything else was good."}

Jeff was very quick to respond and very friendly. Can recommend!\nJeff and Matt has a very lovely 3-storey house - very minimal but well equipped. The house was easy to locate, was based in a neighbourhood with walkable distance to local shops and bars and public transport stops. There is no air conditioning in the house but ceiling fans were enough to get us through the nights as we were mostly out during the day. <br\/>Hosts were very easy to communicate to, few issues during the stay which they were quick to respond to. <br\/>Overall, it was good.\nThis is a lovely house, well equipped and spotless. The location is great with an easy bus into town and lovely local shops, coffee shops and a large supermarket within 5 mins walk. Jeff was a super helpful host and nothing but praise from us.

We'll be back.\nAwesome place , super close to everything you need and was super clean would definitely stay again!\nClean and simple, with the essentials.  Short walk to main road for public transport.  Quite a cold place when the weather is chilly, with mobile heaters in bedrooms and a gas heater in the living space.  <br\/>Great to find a place with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  However, it's worth knowing that the bathrooms are small should this be important.\nVery handy position to CBD, Central Station, Surry Hills and Redfern\/Newtown areas with off street parking. Townhouse was very clean and well presented. Would recommend a stay here .\nGreat space\nBeautiful place!\nAmazing location, close to all but in a quiet spot. The lock up garage was worth it alone for this booking as Sydney parking is a nightmare! A little on the quirky side, which adds to the appeal with three stories and plenty of room to all hangout or getaway from each other when needed! Thanks Jeff for a great Sydney stay!\nGreat location and quiet area. There is some all day parking too if your there at right time\nJeff and Mat were helpful and provided quick responses. Facilities were as expected. Quiet neighbourhood and easy to catch Uber to\/from.

{"listing_id":21243843,"comments":"We had a wonderful stay here over Easter. The house is every bit as beautiful in reality as it appears in the photos. Travelling with small children being able to use Alyssa\u2019s kids lovely playroom was really helpful, and the amenities in the kitchen were so helpful too in preparing kids meals, we even had friends for a dinner party one night. It truly is a home from home, everything you might need is there. Location is quite good, 10\/12 min walk to Queens St in Woollahra and Holdsworth Rd playground, and there are supermarkets, butchers, pharmacy etc in the Edgecliff Train station building which is only 5 mins walk. We hired a car and parked it the garage which again was super handy. We were a bit late in the season to use the pool but Alyssa was helpful in heating it enough for us to use and my kids loved it. Highly recommended!"}

Easy to get to shops and beach of you have transport. Just a few minutes drive. <br\/>Very quiet, you hear the birds through the day and see the greenery. Dean is very accomodating and helped us with everything we needed. We also loved the cute details that make the room pretty and the welcoming biscuits!<br\/>We are a couple with a small baby and would recommend Dean\u2019s place for anyone going to the northern beaches.\nVery clean room in a  beautiful location . The family in which the room was located was very accommodating and lovely to deal with.\nQuiet place and in the middle of the nature. Really beautiful area. Not to far to the city center of Wheeler Height and easy to acc\u00e8s to Sydney.\nClean and comfortable. Situated at the rear of the property, you will need to climb a few steps but it is worth it. The room is part of the larger house which is quiet at night and busy in the mornings. There is a lovely walk around the near by lake  <br\/>and you are central to many great cafes. Very easy parking and I would recommend getting a hire car.\nUnterkunft war klasse. Nette Gastgeber. Klasse Zimmer und kleine M\u00f6glichkeit sich was zum Essen zu machen.

Good location - within walking distance to the lake and easy access to the beaches and restaurants by car.\nGreat place, they even provided breakfast and tea and coffee. Thanks.\nQuaint room with own ensuite located at the rear of the house. No TV but that may suit some guests. You do require a car as it is slightly off the beaten track.\nDean's house was just as it said.  Easy if you have a car.  Your own private space.  Communication with dean was easy.  All in all an easy trip.\nSecond visit and just a good as first visit.  Dean's is a great location - close to many lovely spots on the Northern Beaches. Sherene and Dean are delightful and very accommodating hosts - nothing is too much trouble.<br\/>We will definitely be staying again.<br\/>Susan and Monty\nGreat place, friendly hosts, great value and good location."}

All round great accommodation with loads of conveniences nearby.\nThis was a great stay and a great place that was ultimately marred by the fact host has a security can at his property next door which has a direct view of the bedroom area of the accom. To make matters worse host texted me on Xmas day asking me to reset it with no apology didn't even use my name. I referred it to Airbnb safety team and received a refund. Pity because it is a great stay but feeling like you can be surveilled the whole time in bed etc is just creepy\nAmazing location, great communication. Stairs to the apt were minor. Only issue we had was the fridge is located directly next to the bed and woke us up occasionally when it started and stopped.\nGreat to stay here again, the track to the beach remains a highlight!\nLocation was great, close to restaurants, cafes and beach.\nVery convenient to Bondi Road bus stop local restaurants.

Comfortable bed with everything you need. I would highly recommend! Thanks for a great stay :)\nGreat location and quick walk to the beach. Had a great stay.\nGreat host, very quick at responding and was very helpful on some queries. The place was ideal for us (couple) and the location was a 15 min walk to Bondi, 5\/10 min walk to Tamarama on the road route. 10 minute walk from the nearest grocery shop and a couple of minutes from a few bars\/ restaurants so ideal for anyone wanting to be fairly close to it all. We stayed for around 2\/3 weeks and it was spot on. <br\/>Thanks Sam\nI loved staying here, the location was an absolute dream and the place was spacious, tidy and clean.\nOverall a lovely stay - thanks Sam!<br\/>Sam and Merike were very responsive which was appreciated. Situated in a great location close to beaches, cafes\/restaurants.<br\/>Unfortunately, the studio hadn't been cleaned at the allocated check in time. However, Sam was quick to apologise and prioritised this being cleaned next. When I came back a few hours later to allow ample cleaning time, there was no toilet paper. I had to head back out to the shops to buy this myself, all of the above made me late for my plans.\u00a0They did eventually provide toilet roll days later. I had the airbnb booked for a 2 week stay so I'd hoped for a less hurried clean.\u00a0Studio felt cold and not insulated during bad weather which wouldn't have been an issue in summer but spare blankets would have been appreciated.<br\/>Bed was extremely comfortable\u00a0and the studio had all the appliances I could need. <br\/>Sam was a great host and despite the initial check-in issues, I overall had a comfortable stay and still recommend.<br\/>Thank you!\nVery nice stay thanks!\nHigh ceilings, clean linen, and an amazing \u2018adventurous\u2019 trail down to the beach makes this place lovely.  The strong smell of dirty beach and a bathroom that needs to be detailed made it average.  If you are excited by the surfboard in the pictures, it\u2019s not present.  A washer and dryer have replaced it.  The place has likely seen some heavy traffic since the images were taken."}

Few minutes walk down to beach and Icebergs pool. Shops and restaurants nearby.\nConvenient location and amazing view\nResponsive host and nice place to get around Bondi with amazing view\nIf you want an amazing view of Bondi Beach and be right in the middle of it all, look no further. Gabriel is a very attentive host, and I loved staying in his place.\nVery nice views over Bondi beach. Minor note, the building is a bit old and it can get quite hot.\nAmazing location and views across Bondi Beach.<br\/>Easy to access to the beach, coastal walks and local eateries.\nGreat location and stunning views of Bondi beach.\nThe view from this home is incredible, the location is fantastic with the bus stop right outside and easy access to Bondi Beach. Gabriel was really great with communication and clear instructions!"}

We were initially a bit concerned about sharing a bathroom but this turned out to be no problem at all.  The whole house is spotlessly clean and well fitted out. <br\/>Strathfield is a good location. The train from Strathfield station to the CBD only takes 15 minutes and is very regular and it is on the right side for trips to the Blue Mountains.<br\/>We would definitely stay there again if we return to Sydney.\nVery kind Host, very clean"}

{"listing_id":21698776,"comments":"We had an absolutely lovely stay at Allan and Paola's property. Both hosts were extremely welcoming and made sure we knew our way around the property and appliances. The private entrance to the property makes it feel completely separate and we really enjoyed having the patio area. Can't fault staying here at all, price was excellent and if I'm ever back in Sydney, I'd absolutely be booking again!!\nJust like the last time we had an incredible stay. Paola and Allen were very helpful and accommodating. This is highly recommended.\nThe bed is big enough for me and my 2 daughters to sleep together. The washing machine is quite new and easy to use.<br\/>Because it was a beginning of summer season, we saw many insects inside the room. When we talked about this, Allan and Paola visited us and explained these insects are harmless. Also they gave us mosquito repellent candles and insect killer spray.<br\/>Anyway we enjoyed staying there and hearing birds and cicadas sing.<br\/>Epping is a good town, you can take both the train and the metro to go to the city. The metro is faster, but when you travel by train you can enjoy the view.\nBeautiful peaceful place with great amenities and helpful hosts.\nI thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Allan and Paola\u2019s place. It\u2019s in a beautiful, tranquil location\u2014perfect if you appreciate peace and nature. The area does require a bit of walking, which was a bit of a challenge for my parents, but I found it manageable. I only wish I had more time to explore the Epping area that Allan and Paola recommended\u2014hopefully next time! <br\/>Allan and Paola were incredibly friendly and helpful, even providing extra blankets for my parents who felt the chill. It\u2019s a lovely, quiet place to stay, fully equipped with everything you need for a relaxed visit!\nWe are extremely grateful to find this amazing stay.<br\/>Allan & Paola is very responsive and the place is exactly as described.<br\/>It does have everything as mentioned.<br\/>So happy and will use the service again in future requirements.\nAllan and Paola's place was a fantastic find! The small, cozy studio is well-equipped for a short stay, whether it\u2019s for 2 nights or 10. They were incredibly responsive throughout our stay and provided clear instructions on using everything.<br\/>We appreciated having basic utensils available, which were very helpful. While there are no wardrobes, this wasn\u2019t an issue for us. However, if you need extra storage, keep that in mind.<br\/>One piece of feedback is regarding the hot water; the mixer took a while to warm up, and we experienced some moments of cold water. It took a bit of experimentation and struggle to find the right setting.<br\/>Overall, everything was great and tidy. We would definitely recommend this place!\nA very lovely terrace.\nGreat Stay!!\nIt was lovely to stay with them during our holiday!\nFantastic hosts and a very comfortable spot. Close to the train station, grocery stores, and restaurants.\nWell equipped utensils and a nice air fryer. Convenient transportation to city. Short distance to train station and supermarkets. Prompt response to your request and nice manner.\nnice place with reasonable price! 10min walk to train or by bus which is less than 2min walk\nWe loved our stay here. Allan and Paola were extremely friendly and met us when we checked in to explain all amenities and instructions. We stayed for 4 nights and felt right at home. Great location - close to shopping centre and very peaceful neighbourhood.\nAllan and Paola's  place is  a cozy and well-furnished place with all necessary amenities. The hosts are courteous and pleasant. They are quite helpful and answered all our queries about locating certain areas and transport. Allan also dropped us off to the nearby station. <br\/>Will surely recommend it to others."}

I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would love to stay again. Marika is so friendly, welcoming and helpful.\nGreat stay, thanks!\nClean and tidy private unit. Marika was always responsive and helpful. Location is a short walk to Freshwater or Manly Beach, or take the bus a short walk away. I would recommend Marika's place.\nThe location  is great, but overall, I would say I was disappointed with this accommodation. The biggest single problem was damp  Having a fan and a dehumidifier in a room to make it liveable is not a reasonable situation. Significant amounts of water were condensed by the dehumidifier and the only ventilation possible in the room was to leave the main door open and lock the inner grill door.  You cannot open any windows as they are completely sealed glass units. When we discussed the situation with Marika, she did not really seem to engage with the issue. The shower was very good although it needed a nonslip mat in the shower and somewhere to hang your towel properly. . The main room had a mishmash of rather dated furniture (like an old sideboard) and the curtains didn\u2019t properly close. My wife would not use the wardrobe as it had a significant damp smell. Based on the previous reviews, I was really disappointed with what I saw and frankly surprised.\n.\nExcellent\nGreat spot! Would stay again and recommend."}

Highly responsive (within 30 minutes) when we had any special requests or queries. Location is 10\/10, we used to live in North Bondi and couldn\u2019t have been more delighted with how close it was to all our favourite places to eat and swim.

Very convenient and Peter was very responsive\nSummer Hill is a beautiful peaceful suburb and the house is only 5 minutes from Summer Hill shopping village and train station so extremely convenient. House was big easily accommodated 7 people but needs key upgrades for any longer than an overnight stay. We were there for a week and had to buy fry pan, spatula, coffee cups, dishwasher tabs, garbage bags, dishwashing cloths and scourers and extra toilet paper. I understand there doesn't need to be more than two days supply of some of these things but there were no garbage bags and no dishwasher tablets and I consider a fry pan a cooking basic.The back concrete patio needed a gurney as it was covered in moss and dangerous slippery when it rained. The pillows were bits of stuffing ina fabric bag so not really pillows and the air conditioning filter needed cleaning. So with these upgrades could give a better rating.\nThis place is great with all the facilities needed, and big grocery nearby.

Excellent communication with host. Very much enjoyed.\nGreat cozy one bedroom in Darlinghurst. They let us check in an hour early, and the place was a great spot to explore Sydney's tourist attractions and restaurants.\nGreat location and felt safe. garden is really nice \ud83d\udc9a and the kitchen is very well equipped!\nMy partner and I had a great stay at Maggie\u2019s place - she was really communicative and helpful and the apartment was clean and as described. The apartment is in a lovely area with great shops and restaurants nearby, although the closest public transport stop was about a 10 minute walk away and the area is very hilly so worth considering if you have people who are less mobile.\nThanks Maggie,<br\/>We really valued  your delightful AirbnB in Darlinghurst. The accommodation was stylish, clean and private. We also really appreciated your responsiveness as our host. Kind regards Sharon and Andy\nBeautiful and spacious Airbnb with a very usable kitchen and very conveniently located! The hosts were all extremely responsive and helpful with any questions I had, from how to manage bugs (there are a few for this garden area, just keep the windows closed if this is a problem) to getting in and shipping packages. Really great value for a Sydney flat!\nThe location in Darlinghurst was perfect, and the bed was clean and comfy. There was plenty of natural light in the mornings, though the room didn\u2019t get very dark, which could be an issue for light sleepers.<br\/>One downside was some dust under the bed and in other less obvious spots. Otherwise, it was a pleasant stay that I\u2019d recommend it for the great location.\nKomfortables Apartment in bester Lage, gut ausgestattet\nGreat location. Spacious. Accommodating. thank you!\nGreat place - thank you!\nMaggie\u2019s place was in a beautiful location, with tons of places around for food and drink. Recommended the Rusty Rabbit for an amazing coffee\/breakfast.\nI had a wonderful stay at Maggies and can\u2019t recommend the place enough! It truly has everything you might need to make your stay comfortable. I appreciated the extra touch of the towels and chocolate on the bed too. Maggie was also incredibly helpful and allowed me to check in a little earlier which made a huge difference. Would definitely stay again."}

They were incredibly kind and helpful and the space was lovely! We loved the area and even though we didn\u2019t have the best weather in Bondi, there was so much to do and we had so much fun!\nI was very happy with the apartment. It had everything I needed, a short distance from the bay but residential enough for privacy. A stones throw from \u2018Speedo\u2019s\u2019 cafe for morning coffee and food. Great service too! <br\/>I wasn\u2019t in the apartment that much, as my Bondi\/Sydney trips always involve being outdoors but would loved to have spent more time in the downstairs \u2018den\u2019. The CDs were well appreciated and the system sounded great! <br\/>I\u2019d have appreciated knowing that windows face neighouring walls, but not a deal-breaker. <br\/>I\u2019ll definitely consider staying again next time.\nReally enjoyed our stay here. Claude and Wendy were very welcoming and the airbnb was amazing. Very accommodating and in a great location. Thank you!\nGreat location. Claude and Wendy are extremely welcoming and helpful.

Highly recommend and will return to stay again. <br\/>Thank you!\nBest place to enjoy the beach and the famous Speedo Cafe in Bondi. Cloude and Wendy are exceptionally friendly. The accommodation is much better than the photos suggest. 100m to the beach. We were reluctant to leave this great place.\nReally accommodating, friendly, and welcoming hosts. Lots of thoughtful detail. Would recommend and stay again!\nWe had an amazing one-week stay at this apartment! The location is perfect\u2014just a short walk to the beach and surrounded by fantastic cafes on a charming street, away from the hustle and bustle of Bondi. Claude and Wendy were wonderful hosts, and we had everything we needed. The bed was super comfy! The only small downside was the lack of a view, as there\u2019s a building directly in front, but given the fantastic location, it didn\u2019t bother us at all. Highly recommended!"}

Love it , will stay again\nLoved staying here! <br\/>The unit was clean and comfortable. Food around was amazing and transport was super easy. Highly recommend staying here.\nI really enjoyed my stay at Dean\u2019s place. The place was exactly as expected! A very nice and clean apartment in a great location. Close to public transport, parks and restaurants. The place is full of basic goods for cleaning and cooking. The big balcony was the highlight for me. Dean was very responsive and quick to reply. He welcomed me himself and showed me everything, which was really helpful. It was a very nice 5 weeks and I would love to come back! Highly recommend!\nMy husband and I stayed here for a month. The place was well equipped and had what we needed for our stay. The bed was comfortable, the balcony was nice to have though we did not use it much since it was winter. The aspect we valued most was the location. The are many food options in Spice Alley right downstairs, as well as places in Haymarket and Surrey Hills. We also frequented Koi for their fabulous desserts. We swim and used the Ian Thorpe pool, about a 10 minute walk away. We walked almost everywhere. The Opera House was about a 45-50 minute walk. When places were farther away, Central train station and numerous bus stops are nearby. We booked it for the day before we arrived so we could move in right after our flight. Dean was to meet us but our flight was a little delayed so he made arrangements for us to get the keys. Dean was very responsive most of the time but once I had to follow up after about a day about an issue. There was some street noise but it didn't bother us.\nGreat place centrally located. Very close to a central station for super easy access around Sydney.\nh\u00f4te r\u00e9actif   <br\/>appartement propre et bien situ\u00e9\nGreat apartment in a great location with a great host. Repeat visitor.\nLovely place & Dean was lovely and really accommodating. Very clean and lovely balcony which was nice to eat breakfast on in the morning\nDean's place was as described but very overpriced. Nearby hotels were cheaper\nGreat place for a week or a weekend stay. Dean was exceptionally friendly and went out of his way to make sure that he was there to welcome me and recommend place to eat and drink. It's a great location for getting out and about. Loads of cafes, restaurants, and pubs and one of my favourite cinemas in Sydney, the Palace cinema in the Central Park Mall. You'll have trains and buses on the doorstep and an easy 5 minute walk to the closest Light Rail stop bringing you in to the heart of Sydney. The apartment, although maybe a little small for someone with a lot of luggage was clean with a comfortable bed and hot strong shower. Even though the apartment is close to pubs and the famous Spice Alley, it was surprisingly quiet but may not suit very light sleepers. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Dean.\nCan\u2019t imagine a better place to stay in Sydney\u2014between the amazing private balcony and being a short walk from Central Station and Spice Alley, this apartment delivered on all fronts.

Nice hot shower with  towels and clean bedding. We were there in winter so it wasn\u2019t hot in the unit like others noted. <br\/>If you have a car and are booking for free parking I\u2019d say it\u2019s not ideal for that. It only has one spot on site and it\u2019s always taken! And free street parking is just 2 hours and 4 hours if you\u2019re lucky. So if you plan to leave your car and your around you\u2019ll be worrying about getting a ticket. We ended up having to pay for a parkade down by the opera house because it\u2019s the only one close by that has 2.1 metre allowance. $37 for a night. <br\/>Otherwise, cute spot for people without a vehicle!\nLovely apartment in a great location. Communication with the hosts is excellent. Very responsive and attentive. The apartment is as described, with a decent kitchen and plenty of space. The only downside was that it was very hot weather while I was staying there and it did stay hot overnight with no aircon, but there was a fan provided which helped. <br\/>Overall a great place and I would recommend it.\nAmazing location, very clean and well equipped apartment, friendly and responsive host\nThe location was easily accessible to get to the city or wherever you needed, however we found the room to be very stuffy and hot due to no cooling whatsoever, we actually bought a fan for the room, (which has been left behind, enjoy). The only windows looking out of the room were directly towards other rooms within the complex which were less than 2 metres away which gave no privacy. Overall it was okay for the price, but wouldn\u2019t want to be staying there long term or over the summer.\nI had a great stay - I was there for a month which was perfect as the place was well set up to cater for that. The kitchen had everything I needed for cooking, even included things like tupperware. The location was fantastic - loved walking down to Rushcutters Bay and seeing all the yachts. And Phil is a fantastic host - super helpful, responsive and friendly.\nThe place could use a bit of love and small repairs. It is very dark in the apartment throughout the day and I didn\u2019t feel like being there during the day. I thought there would be a washing machine inside the apartment. There wasn\u2019t. There were washing machines in the basement, but I really didn\u2019t feel like using them. There\u2019s a house cat living in the hallway\nThis apartment is in a great location close to Kings Cross. It is exactly as it looks in the pictures, was clean and has everything you need. Communication with Phillip who manages the apartment was extremely clear and quick, check in and check out were very easy. I'd recommend this place to stay again.\nWe immediately loved the apartment and would have loved to stay there way longer! The location is perfect as Kings Cross with supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and bars is in easy walking distance. Phillip, the co-host, was very friendly and helpful. Thank you for that amazing stay!\nPhil is a great co-host. He is pro-active and responsive and whatever Jenny and Andrew are paying him should be doubled :) Thank you for making my nephew's stay an easy and relaxing experience.\n\uc5d0\ub974\ubca0\uc774\ud138\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\uba74 \uc5ec\uae30\ub974\uc744 \uc11c\uc5b8\ud0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc744\uace0\uc5d0\uc5ec\uc694\uc624 \uc0bc\uce35\uc774\uc778\ub370 \uce90\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc5b4 \ub315\ubb34\uac81\uac8c \uc62c\ub77c\uac10 \uc81c\uc5d4\uc7a5<br\/>\ud558<br\/>\uc77c\ub2e4\ub208 \uc694\uc625\uc870\uc624 \ud398\uc774\uc778\ud2f0\uc789\uc774 \ub2e4 \uae4c\uc838\uc788\uaddc<br\/>\uc0e4\uc544\uc6cc\uae30\uc774 \uc9e7\ubc14\uc11c \uc0e4\uc6cc \uac01 \uc548\ub098\uc624\uaddc<br\/>\ubb3c \uc138\uac8c \ud2b8\uc744\uba74 \uc0e4\uc6cc\uae30\uc5d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c \ubfdc\uaddc<br\/>\ubc14\ub2e4\uc545 \uba38\uc5b8\uc9c0 \ub9ce\uaddc<br\/>\uc218\uc6b0\uac74\ub3c4 \ud070 \uac70 \uc138\uac1c\ubc16\uaed8 \uc548\uc8fc\uaddc<br\/>\uc1fc\uc624\ud30c \uc5bc\ub8e9<br\/>\uc138\uba74\ub300\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc791\uaddc<br\/>\uc554\ud2bc \ube44\uc774\u3163\u3163\uc774\uc774\u3163\u3163\u3163\ucd94\ucd94\uce04 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2f9\nWhile the space was lovely in and of itself, I was disappointed to find that the reasons I had decided to book here hadn't quite been as described. The listing mentioned a washing machine in the unit as well as the building, however there is not one available in the home itself, and the coin operated machines only accept $1 and 20c coins specifically. The promise of parking onsite had also been a selling point- and although I was warned it was first in first served, I was not told there are a total of 6 spots available for two entire unit buildings. The 'plenty of free parking nearby' was also very misleading, as most streets were ticket parking only, and had a limit of 4 hours max (and even then so rare to find), which meant I had to rearrange my plans to make sure I always took the car with me. <br\/>No fault of the hosts, but for 2 nights the front door was also broken, and when I was checking out the lockbox had disappeared.<br\/>Philip was a very responsive co-host though- thank you Phil!\nPhil was the perfect host - He was always friendly, easy to reach and took great care of us. Anytime again!"}
{"listing_id":23652871,"comments":"We absolutely loved our stay at Oxley Boatshed, such a unique and memorable experience! <br\/>The kitchen is incredibly well equipped, and we were lucky to have a boat big enough to enjoy both Berowra Waters Inn and The Spencer Anchor, each offering a distinct and amazing experience. We were blessed with perfect weather, which made it all the more special.<br\/>Thank you, Jacqui, we hope to return soon!\nWords simply do not do this place justice.<br\/>Jacqui was so helpful and made sure we felt right at home the minute we stepped through the doors.<br\/>Amazing to sit in the big doors and watch a storm and great fishing from jetty.<br\/>Every amenity has been thought of and it really was one of the nicest places we have stayed and will definitely be back.\nWhat an amazing place to stay and unwind from the hustle and bustle of our normal lives........Reading a book, having a crack at a bit of fishing and just sitting on the deck with a beer watching the world float by.<br\/>Beautiful surroundings, peaceful and very comfortable well stocked house.<br\/>Everything we needed was there and the house was set up perfectly for when we arrived with the radio on, lights and fans on and even the insect coils burning.<br\/>We will be back one day I am sure of that and would recommend this place if you want to get away and just relax\nWe loved our long weekend here. Would recommend to others\nI was in heaven!- perfect spot perfect venue perfect weather\nRustic property in a bucolic spot. <br\/>Lots of wildlife about. <br\/>Jacqui is an attentive host who really goes the extra mile to make your stay comfortable. Thanks!\nThis is the perfect spot for an escape away from everything. On the river away from it all yet easy to get to by boat from anywhere in Pittwater, Bobbin Head or Brooklyn. The boatshed has a wonderful feel about it, right on the water with lots of comfortable spots to relax and watch the world go by. You've also got everything you need to eat and sleep well too.  Highly recommended.\nIf your looking for an amazing, unique and private place full of interesting details, right on the water and I mean right in the water do not hesitate to book the Oxley Boatshed. There are little cool details in every corner-  a private beach with sandstone steps at the right tide, lots of nooks and crannies for all the members of the family. It\u2019s like being in a lovingly restored barn that\u2019s kinda like an art gallery placed on the waters edge.  The photos don\u2019t capture the true atmosphere. Thank Jacqui...we will be back!\nSpacious and peaceful!  We stayed for a weekend and with Jacqui's help we planned a fabulous weekend, including lunch at Peat's Bite (AMAZING!), lunch at Spencer Village Store (great burgers) and a boat hired from Brooklyn Central.  There was loads of room for our family of four and we had a fantastic weekend.  We'd definitely be back!  Tip: bring lots of firewood!\nGreat place, Thank you Jacquie ! 5\/5\nWith a stunning outlook over the lake and a wonderful cozy space, it makes for a perfect weekend getaway\nWe adore the rustic space of Oxley Boatshed. <br\/>It\u2019s certainly a place we found a deep sense of relaxation, very grateful for hosts to share a place I would love to own, only gratitude to you, may you live a very long life.\nSuch an amazing gem. Absolutely loved the boathouse.  Tastefully styled with everything you could need . We were a group of four adults and there was so much space . Loved every minute of it. We would definitely return to Oxley.\nThe Oxley Boatshed exceeded all expectations. Such a beautiful location which took us all by surprise on arrival. We took plenty to eat and drink for the weekend and therefore had no real need to leave the property. Nor would you want to. Waking up to the sun streaming through the windows and jumping straight in the river was a highlight. Jacqui was terrific to deal with providing much information before our arrival. Certainly an great and easy getaway option for anyone living in Sydney and definitely plan on returning.\nGreat getaway, unbelievable location and place! Will be back"}

Dominiques home is stunning but has such a welcoming atmosphere. We loved the open plan lounge, dining kitchen which led out to a lovely outdoor dining area and we especially loved the little terrace which was perfect for sunset drinks. Bedrooms were spacious & private which afforded us a sound & peaceful sleep. We enjoyed the walk to the mall & beaches, this is such a beautiful location. We all genuinely loved our stay in Dominiques home and we will definitely book again, 10 out of 10!!!\nThank you Dominique, your new apartment is gorgeous. Thank you for making us so welcome. We appreciate the little extra touches you provided in order to make us feel like we were staying in 5 star boutique hotel. We will definitely be back.\nThankyou Dominique for welcoming us and for providing such beautiful accomodation. We truly enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable. Your attention to detail was greatly appreciated. Highly recommend!"}
{"listing_id":23901619,"comments":"Nice experience of staying.<br\/>Very friendly and responsive owner.\nClaudia had excellent communication from the time of booking onwards. Throughout the stay we had some feedback on a couple of things and she continued to be responsive. The location of this place is its strength, with such ease of access to get out and about by car, on foot, or public transport. The decor is tastefully put together, uncluttered and there are all the amenities required to feel right at home.<br\/>Water shower pressure wasn\u2019t great, however Claudia assured us this is being looked into.<br\/>Overall a wonderful stay. Highly recommended!\nGreat place in a fantastic location, some noisy neighbours around Christmas \u2026 but can\u2019t fault Claudia for that. Would stay again\nThis is our second stay at this lovely place! We love it, thanks Claudia\nI am a returning custmer to Claudia's lovely abode and once again enchanted by the location and stye. Claudia is just the loveliest host - fexble and frendly. I hope we see you again.\nLovely home in a central but quiet location. Simple, easy and comfortable accommodation just moments to a lot of Sydney\u2019s best inner city spots. Host was obliging and easy to communicate with.\nLovely location. Great place to stay. Safe and quiet side street. Construction is going on next door but the noise was only disruptive one of the days we were there. Very nice place to stay in Sydney!\nAwesome place down a cute, quiet little laneway in Darlinghurst. Very close to Hyde Park, Surrey Hills, and the CBD. Great little coffee shops within 2 blocks. Sadly it rained almost the entire time, so we didn\u2019t get to enjoy the beautiful terrace and we did experience some leaking in the laundry and around a door (but it didn\u2019t affect our comfort). The space itself is really well designed. The bed and shower were just okay, but everything was clean, lots of towels, and a spacious living area and kitchen. Claudia was very responsive and overall it was a great place to stay in Sydney, and probably even more enjoyable if you can make use of the terrace.\nClaudia was a very responsive and kind hostess during our 5 day stay. There was construction next door (totally out of her control) and she did everything she could to help us still be comfortable. <br\/>the house itself is beautiful and the location is incredible. you have tons of restaurants and cafes within walking distance as well as the subway and 2 grocery stores. you're in the heart of Sydney but since it's down an adorable cobblestone lane you don't get the city noise and traffic.<br\/>just an ideal location and overall a great place to stay. you will not be disappointed! <br\/>thank you Claudia!\nFor the two of us this was a great place to stay.  Sydney was hot but the ceiling fans and aircon worked well.  The kitchen is beautiful and really well stocked.  The best thing is the area - a very peaceful and gorgeous laneway and an easy walk  to great cafes and restaurants - Surry Hills, Oxford Street, the parks, the city - all an easy walk.<br\/>Claudia is a very responsive host. <br\/>The only downside was building work started next door the day before we left.  I did not want to say anything  negative as we loved our stay and this is beyond the host's control.\nLovely place in a central sydney location. we were able to walk just about anywhere interesting. Claudia was very attentive and helpful.\nWonderful little townhouse in the heart of everything. Many coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants nearby. There is also a very nice playground for younger kids couple mins walk. <br\/>Very close to Surry Hills. Easy to drive from airport. Claudia was super responsive and helpful. <br\/>One thing to note parking is actually not on the street but in a carpark about 5-7min walk. Great place otherwise all in all!\nClaudia\u2019s place served us great for our stay.  It\u2019s bright and quiet with a lovely outdoor terrace and lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Claudia was also a really accommodating and helpful host.\nLovely and comfortable stay in a charming neighborhood. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thoughtfully appointed and convenient to everyting.\nSuch a cute place in a charming neighborhood. Close to everything, full of light, clean and comfortable."}
{"listing_id":24162879,"comments":"Fantastic location in Rose Bay. Beautiful and peaceful neighbourhood. Grocery store 2 minutes away, larger supermarket about 20 minutes walk. 10 minute walk to the ferry wharf so easy access to the city. 30 minutes walk to Bondi beach. Easy check-in, room was as described. Budget friendly and worth the price for what was offered. William allowed me to do simple cooking which was great. His place is also full of antiques and interesting bits and pieces which I thought was quirky and gave it character and a lovely feel. However communication could have been better. Sent a few messages both on Airbnb and phone  prior to arrival but was not answered. William\u2019s mannerism and interactions as a host could have been better too, but maybe that\u2019s just his character. Overall a good experience.\nReally good place to stay while visiting Sydney.\nExcellent host\nGood\nVery nice host, place and location.\nDie Unterkunft ist leider nicht besonders sauber und total zugestellt mit irgendwelchen Dingen. Ich finde sie nicht geeignet als Airbnb.<br\/>Ich hatte im voraus gefragt, ob ein Freund auch kommen darf und die 2 N\u00f6chte bleiben. William hat zugestimmt und ich habe auch angeboten mehr zu zahlen, worauf er nicht reagiert hat und es auch nie angesprochen hat. Beim Check out kam William dann auch uns zu und wollte 100$ extra f\u00fcr die beiden N\u00e4chte was relativ viel ist in Anbetracht der Wohnung und weil mein Freund die erste Nacht auf den Sofa praktisch nicht geschlafen hat weil alle 30 Minuten ein Alarm geklingelt hat. Naja wir haben ihm das Geld dann trotzdem in Bar geben und dann wurde William super unfreundlich und respektlos und hat uns beschimpft.<br\/>Ich w\u00fcrde die Unterkunft auf Grund der genannten Punkte nicht weiterempfehlen.\nWilliam is nice and easy to deal with. The apartment is well located and easy to catch buses to  Edgecliff and Bondi Junction stations. Alternatively, take ferry from Rose bay dock to the city takes only 15 minutes.\nWilliam was a great host! Always helpful when something was needed, and did a good job of explaining all necessary things. Along with that he was a very nice guy, who wasn\u2019t afraid of having a good chat! Would definitely recommend\nGreat value for money and good location. William is kind and helpful. Handy accommodation for a solo traveller\/quick stay. <br\/>Heads up though: Mind the cockatoos very early in the morning. I\u2019ve lived in Australia for 15 years and have come across lots of bird noise during this time, never experienced this level of noise. The bedroom is right next to a couple of gigantic trees full of birds (ear plugs are a must).\nWas a really good place to stay and William is friendly and good to chat with\nI really liked William's place, I felt at home here. William is a very nice person, he helped me with all my questions. <br\/>The accommodation is located in a beautiful location, close to the city and the beach. <br\/>I absolutely recommend and thank you once again.\nWilliam is an experienced host. He is as helpful as much as you need him to be. He engages in conversations easily, whilst respectful of guest's requirements. Many thanks.\nWilliam was super friendly, very nice to chat with and perfectly located within walking distance to a lot of things. Thanks again William\nWilliam has been a great host. The accomodation is well located between Bondi and the CBD, close to a ferry terminal.\nGreat"}

I'd stay at Carol and Ian's place again.\nI stayed for one night only - place is well located and is a lovely clean apt. Room doesn\u2019t have a lot of space but overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay again."}
{"listing_id":25171755,"comments":"Great place to stay and exactly like the pictures - very clean and fantastic location just a short walk from Bondi with plenty of shops\/restaurants\/cafes round about. Brilliant view from the balcony!\nGreat location, great host!\nWe absolutely loved our stay <br\/>We stayed here while renovating our new house. It was easy, convenient, clean and such a great location <br\/>Only thing I would change is the big bed to be in the master room\nI would like to give this apartment 5 stars across the board because it was extremely clean, nicely furnished, light-filled and with a lovely breeze always available by opening the windows - there were just a few small issues that prevent me from doing so. We lost hot water one morning and use of the lift for about 24 hours. We had my 75 year old sister-in-law with us and the walk up 6 flights of stairs was a challenge for all of us. Also, no response about the hot water issue. Lastly, someone else parked in our designated parking space on the last day of our stay and we were forced to find street parking. We expected an offer of a partial refund for these inconveniences, but none was given. All said, however, I would probably stay here again as the location near Bondi Road and all its restaurants and stores was great, and the apartment itself was immaculate, spacious and comfortable. FYI - long walk uphill from Bondi beach.\nVery nice place with a lovely ocean view close to many things in Bondi. I would definitely book it again!\nLovely stay, great location, and accomodation better than the pictures. Thank you for the prompt reply and making it easy check in and out process. We will definitely stay again and recommend to friends.\nNeat apartment nice view everything you need easy check in and out\nSpacious light apartment with lovely view. Secure building, close to handy shops. Super comfortable beds and great showers. Clean with good kitchen and laundry. <br\/>Parking space a bit tight but not unexpected in this type of apartment building. Fine for a small car. <br\/>Some small issues sorted out promptly by Hotelesque.\nThis is a lovely apartment with a great view. Very well equipped, comfortable beds and good quality bed linen. Host was very helpful. I\u2019d definitely book it again. Short walk<br\/>to Bondi, plenty of shops and cafes on the doorstep including baker and Fruitologist -fantastic grocers with juice bar.\nWe had a lovely stay with you! Great view, very clean, and extremely stylish. I would highly recommend this place to anyone as it had a great location to cafes and popular restaurants but also felt relaxing as you were so high up.\nThe apartment itself was nice we had some issues and we tried to address via the Managing company. Overall it\u2019s a nice apartment, but we stayed one street away the previous week and we paid much lower rate for a more spacious, modern apartment, so for us it was not worth the money and especially when faced with additional admin costs which are very high in our view for the property on the top of a high nightly rate and cleaning charges\nAmazing apartment, beautiful balcony views and great location.Highly recommended for a relaxing extended stay .\nWhat a beautiful apartment. Everything was great. The cleanliness, the space, view, location, safety I could go on. Thankyou!\nLovely space and great location\nVery highly recommended. We had a wonderful stay. 4 people was perfectly comfortable. The views are epic, location is perfect off Bondi road but without any street noise. The apartment is clean and beautiful with everything you might need. I\u2019d love to stay here again."}
{"listing_id":25174383,"comments":"Great stay - walking distance for all amenities & activities.\nTommy is one of the best hosts we have ever had. Great Communcation and very accommodating. The apartment was bigger than we thought which was an added bonus!! <br\/>100% would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Sydney \ud83d\ude03 it\u2019s the perfect location you are 5 minutes walk to shops and 20 min walk to Opera House and many more. <br\/>Thank you Tommy for making our first stay in Sydney so special\nThe location of the accommodation was perfect for traveling. If you have children, it's a good idea to stay near Darling Square, and this place was conveniently close to the playground there, making evening walks with my child easy. Additionally, the surrounding restaurants were all excellent, which was very convenient.<br\/>The host, Tony, was very kind and provided clear instructions for the check-in process. However, there were two issues with this accommodation.<br\/>First, small flying insects occasionally appeared in the bathroom. They were more frequent on cloudy days, which was quite troublesome. While I\u2019m not particularly afraid of bugs, the continuous appearance of these insects was stressful.<br\/>Second, the traffic noise was so loud that I couldn't leave the window open. Those who are sensitive to noise should take this into consideration.<br\/>Despite these issues, thanks to Tony's thoughtful preparations, I was able to live comfortably for a month and a half without any major inconvenient.\nHonestly such a great stay in Sydney!! Was the perfect place for my mum and I. Great location, one block to the qvb, city centre. Tommy was so friendly and easy to communicate with, he even allowed us to keep our luggage in another unit as we had a late flight out so we didn\u2019t have to carry it around with us all day! Would absolutely visit again \u263a\ufe0f\ngreat stay\nTommy was very flexible and accommodating during the check in process which made it easy since our travel plans put us to his place earlier than planned.\nit was a great apartment, clean and comfortable and close to everything.\nGood size apartment. Great location, close to everything. Some traffic noise, as expected. Host is helpful and responsive.\nGood, convenient place in the city to stay for my work trips!\nOverall was great, had everything you would need from an airbnb.<br\/>It was Australian winter when I visited so it did get cold in the airbnb, so if you are staying in the winter keep that in mind! There is a portable heater tho, which was great. <br\/>The airbnb came with everything I needed.<br\/>The wifi was great.<br\/>Getting in was simple enough.\nTommy met us promptly for key turnover.  We were upgraded at check in to Tommy\u2019s two bedroom unit on the 13th floor of the same building due to a hot water issue in the one bedroom. The apartment was spacious, very clean and offered good amenities.  The little balcony provided nice a view of the sunset on the Harbour.  We were happy to find DVDs and tourist guidebooks in the apartment as well. <br\/>Building is in a terrific location to walk and explore Darling Harbour, the CBD, QVB, Hyde Park, The Mint, many churches including St Mary of the Cross, The Aquarium, museums, Chinatown, the Convention Center, the Chinese Friendship Garden, several parks, bars, restaurants and convenience stores.  Transportation is easy with Uber or on the Lightrail to reach outlying areas like Bondi or the Sydney Opera House, the Rocks and Harbour Bridge. The gym and pool areas could use a little upgrading, if just a fresh coat of paint on the walls. The building itself is very secure. We recommend this place to future guests.\nWhat a great location.  Really fantastic spot with a short walk to King Street Wharf and across to Darling Harbour.  Circular Key only a 15 minute walk away too!  Fantastic coffee shops nearby and nice and clean apartment with everything you need to cook with, clean with and be comfortable.  Very friendly and accomodating host.\n\u00d3timo localiza\u00e7\u00e3o, poss\u00edvel fazer quase tudo a p\u00e9. Apartamento espa\u00e7oso, e arejado...<br\/>Tommy foi muito atencioso! \u00d3timo anfitri\u00e3o!<br\/>Os \u00fanicos pontos negativos foram o barulho da rua e o quarto com claridade.\nAn impeccably clean, well equipped and comfortable apartment in a central location, within an easy walking distance of Central Quay, the Rocks and the Opera House.\nWhat a fantastic apartment. Tommy was so very helpful. Great at communicating from the time we landed at Sydney. We requested more clothes hangars and how to use the washing machine and within 10 mins he arranged someone to show us. The position could not be better. A 3 min walk to Darling Harbour with all the fab restaurants.  Would definitely stay again when next in Sydney (which can\u2019t be soon enough!!!)."}

I would definitely recommend this place and would love to stay again if was cozy, clean and I loved the interior mirrors made the place feel huge.\nWe had absolutely comfort stay.<br\/>Nothing to complain about!! <br\/>If I have chance, I will return!!\nWonderful stay while working remotely! Great setup and strong wifi! We were at Trudy\u2019s for five days and were very comfortable! Gorgeous apartment, beautiful breezes and ample natural light, a real gem in Sydney! It was about 20min uber (or 45min bus) to major tourist sites. Trudy was very responsive!!\nVery nice place if you want to stay near Sydney CBD. You can use public transport to travel with no hassle to find paid parking in CBD.\nGreat spot to stay in Sydney! Easy access to public transport.\nMeilleur Airbnb qu'on ait eu!<br\/>Trudy et Nicolas sont super.<br\/>Le logement ressemble vraiment aux photos.<br\/>Les hotes sont super reactifs et toujours agr\u00e9ables.<br\/>Nous sommes rest\u00e9s 1 mois et nous avons travaill\u00e9 a 2.

This listing was comfortable, well-appointed, and very clean, as advertised. The versatile kitchenette worked for us because we could self-cater. And we liked that decent cafes and supermarkets were within walking distance.\nwe hebben een prima verblijf gehad.<br\/>Trudy is een prima host.\nI had a lovely relaxed stay. Everything was as described , no unpleasant surprises !  <br\/>There were lovely surprises  like butter, milk and bread in the fridge, real coffee and a plunger , and rare for an Airbnb , a big book shelf full of good books and games ! <br\/>Another pleasure for the older traveller was that the tiles in the shower were very safe .  When wet, the tiles had a non- slip quality , very reassuring for an older person. <br\/>And the bed was very comfortable.\nThis was my second stay at Trudy's and like the first time immaculately clean, cosy and very comfortable.  I stayed as close to my work and it beat a hotel on soluless serviced apartment hands down.<br\/>On my first visit I made a suggestion about a minor enhancement and Trudy had already addressed it by the time I'd booked again - shows level of consideration to making guests comfortable.

In a lovely, leafy suburb it was very cosy, spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfy.  This was the perfect bolt-hole.  Communication was great and as I arrived in late evening Trudy turned lights and heater on which made arrival very welcoming.

Very central location and easy access to trains and buses. There isn't a central heating system so can get a little cold at night and there isn't much ventilation throughout the apartment so it can get humid when showering or operating the dryer. Aside from that I had a lovely time at this apartment and would stay again!\nThanks for the great stay! John was very easy to communicate with and helped us with everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. The location was fantastic!\nVery dusty, stinky and simple Accomondation. The flat did not match the pictures and the smell when we got in was so strong. The fridge was also out and we couldn't store our groceries. The flat was far too overpriced for that. Just the Location was very nice.\nAwful place\nIdeal place, it\u2019s very conveniently located for the train station and some good bars\/ restaurants. Check in was quick and friendly and queries were dealt with very efficiently.\nUpon arrival i found the door wide open. Someone must have been in the flat as towels were in disorder as well as the bedding. I immediately texted John but i didn\u2019t get a response until the next morning. Although feeling very uncomfortable and unsafe there, i decided to stay the night as it was already evening. In the bedroom was some clutter under the window, a tabletop and a frame, which even they didn\u2019t know about. Since the airbnb seems to be owned by a company,your conversation is not only with John but also with his coworkers. So when i saw John the next morning when he came in with pest control,  he didn\u2019t know about the conversation.Due to the unpleasant circumstances we agreed that i didn\u2019t wanna stay the 9 nights as planned as well as on a full refund. As o f now i am still missing 174\u20ac of that.<br\/>In the past i always had great experiences with airbnb, this time i didn\u2019t <br\/>The flat is a lot more run down than in the photos, stained and old carpet, smell of mold in the bedroom.\nWe loved our stay here. We were able check in early and check out late, and John was brilliant - very responsive and flexible. We could leave our bags in the office for storage too! The place was a bit dusty and could do with a bit of a deep clean, but overall it was a great place to stay and the location is very central, only a short walk away from Kings Cross station. There are also some lovely cafes and restaurants in the area so you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice!\nLocation is nice, close to CBD and train station. <br\/>Unit is ok, it looks a bit old compared to the photos and is a bit cold inside during winter.

Walking distance to the central train station and walkable to everywhere in Sydney. Place is perfect to sleep in and the staff is very kind and helpful!\nIt was perfect. Only point is, as mentioned by someone else, the shower curtain doesn't keep all the water out so after you use your towel have to wipe the floor with it\nIt was a let down, the bathroom was dirty - mould on the grout, soap scum left on the shower shelf, toothpaste and other grot around the sink plug. You could even see the accumulation of others ahhh\u2026 thicker shorter hair through the grates of the shower drain. There was even a booger on the wall, and some foreign white stains down the face of all furniture. I opened up one of the drawers to use the iron and the drawer was FULL of mould. All their appliances, iron, hair dryer and TV are extremely old. If you want to stream something you need to bring a laptop & HDMI cable. The hair dryer looked unsafe to use. There\u2019s no windows to open or look out of, only one frosted window in the bathroom that is the only supply of natural light to the entire room. The only thing that was a saving grace for me was the location. It\u2019s quiet but so close to the light rail and central station (yet no noise) and a lot of beautiful restaurants, pubs, and cafes in walking distance.\nLovely stay\nGreat location.

We\u2019re already planning on when we can come back.\nThis is the most beautiful Airbnb i have ever stayed in! <br\/>Sue was incredibly patient in teaching us how to us the boat and explaining where and how to park it.<br\/>Sue lives close by and said that if we needed anything at all to call her. This was reassuring because it was our first time at a boat only access property.<br\/>As soon as you step into thhe home you are struck with the water beauty. To me the home felt like a family had grown up coming here every summer holidays, with all the books and puzzles getting more advanced as kids got older. It gave the property an instant comfortable, homey feel, and i could feel the beautiful memories.<br\/>The only bit of caution i have is while our small dog came with us and LOVED it, there was no grass for him to access - it wasnt a problem for us at all but I know some puppers are very particular. And the stair up to the main bedroom are more like a ladder than stairs.<br\/>We will be back for a longer stay next time.

Sue was a great host and we really appreciated our dog being as welcome as we were.\nBest part of the stay was the very spectacular location . The cottage was quaint and comfortable. The use of the boat was great. Luckily there was only 2 of us as the stairs to the second level bedroom were precarious and with no air conditioner up there too hot to sleep in. Be aware you do share some outside spaces with the guests staying in the upper unit . <br\/>Overall a nice place to stay for a relaxing weekend away for 2.\nSuch a beautiful location.

We loved sitting on the balcony and watching the cockatoos. Lola's instructions were helpful, clear, and thorough. The location is amazing, with incredible bars and restaurants mere footsteps away and the centre of Sydney just 10 mins. This was a much cheaper option than a hotel, and I personally prefer to get to know a city properly by staying in a more residential suburb.\nWe were grateful for so many things- the location was a great gift to us. It helped us maximize our time; allowing us to do more!\nThanks for the stay. Small but good location, clean and easy communication with Lola.\nLovely and comfortable stay\nThanks to Lola, great location, beautiful and cozy apartment.\nAmazing space convenient location really loved the stay.

Kim was very warm, thoughtful and welcoming. She set up the sofa bed for us ahead of our arrival so we could transfer our two tiny humans from the car to bed easily. The kids loved the pool too.\nWe loved our stay. The property was immaculately clean, beautifully decorated, and felt like a home away from home.

Thank you Kim.\nHapp to stay in a quiet place for a few days.\nHonestly, the photos don\u2019t do this place justice. It is INCREDIBLY peaceful - from the frogs at night to the birds in the morning. Kim was very responsive in ensuring our stay was smooth and we felt very welcomed. Thanks for accommodating us!\nSuch a cute little place that had an amazing interior. Myself and my 4 month old stayed here and it was a home away from home for us. Not once did Kim mention him being too loud which for mums with young bubs tend to get worried about. <br\/>The accomodation has great lighting from sunroofs and plantation shutters throughout so you can keep doors & windows open to let in the fresh breeze\/ light but with the privacy.  Has all the amenities needed plus a google assistant which is a bonus if you want to listen to music etc. <br\/>Bathroom is stocked with everything you\u2019d need. The only thing I would throw in as a suggestion with the kitchen is a spray and wipe for benches and possibly a bigger frypan. But either way it\u2019s perfect! <br\/>Kim is lovely and was very accomodating.<br\/>She\u2019s done very well with this listing. Would definitely recommend to friends\/family.\nI had a wonderful stay at this lovely Airbnb in Baulkham Hills. The place was exceptionally well-equipped with everything I needed, including a full kitchen, hair dryer, and plenty of towels. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and I loved how easy it was to park. It\u2019s a quiet and private spot, making it perfect for a relaxing getaway. The only small thing to note is that the birds wake up early, so you might want to bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper\u2014but that\u2019s just nature! Overall, a fantastic stay\u2014I highly recommend it!\nGreat little base to be close to family in Baulkham Hills. Thanks for hosting us.\nOK for stay with 2 adults, but not a family with children. The location is good but remote. I take more than 15mins to find the place as it is dark when I arrived. Overall OK."}

House is nice and spacious with great facilities and Benny was a lovely, clean, attentive host. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone staying long or short term in Sydney.\nBenny is absolutely the best host I could have asked for. He is really caring and a genuinely nice guy. lots of privacy and comfort at his place. Highly recommended.\nBenny is a great host, lovely man to talk to and keeps a very clean house. Was very impressed how clean the place and how fresh it makes you feel. There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about the house but it definitely felt like home during the short time I was there.

The area was walkable to the CBD and central station was only 10 mins away. The kitchen was fully kitted out with everything we needed to cook meals and the flat was immaculately clean. Thais\u2019 recommendations were great too and very informative and she was very proactive at messaging for check in and to see if we were doing okay! :)\nGreat place to stay. Exceptionally clean and tidy. Near Central Station and City Centre, very walkable. Despite it being near the train station, the unit was very quiet (good insulated glass doors).

We kept using the balcony to dry our washing - which we didn't realise until the last day until we saw the sign, that we weren't allowed!! However, the lovely neighbour who we think lived there, never moaned at us once! She even helped us bring the maiden down.

And also, very close to city and everything walk distance but my favorite part is that the studio is very close to the park that you could have a nice walk and see lot of dogs playing in the morning. Thais was very helpful with all the information I need and friendly.\nHad a great stay here, everything as described.<br\/>Wanted somewhere close to circular quay but not mega bucks(Redfern Station is 500m away, Harbour is only 4 stops and so quick and cheap.\nSmall but nice place, has everything you need.

{"listing_id":29726626,"comments":"We had a lovely stay with Kathy, the area is beautiful (and although hilly) there's lots of public transport options nearby to get around Sydney. Lots of little cafe's and the main street is also only a 15 minute walk away. The house matched the description, and was very well presented. We had an issue with the front door while staying there, but it was fixed the same day. The one thing that was slightly inconvenient was the height of the shower head in the second bathroom (only being around chest height, and I'm fairly standard height) meant that shower couldn't really be used to wash hair. Luckily the shower in the ensuite was fine, so I just had to coordinate showering time with the people I was staying with. Would definitely stay again if I was back in the area\nTerrific location - close to public transport and great eating spots - highly recommend Charlotte's for breakfast and The Dry Dock for dinner - all within walking distance. Kathleen is an excellent communicator. Middle of summer in Australia is hot - house could do with an extra fan (and extension cords) and even another split system.\nwe had had a lovely week at this home. it is an older style cottage, it is as described and as photos show. it is kept clean, and comfortable, the area is quiet and safe and it is location, location. we used the bus and ferry which are both nearby and walked the local area and to a nearby Cafe. It caters for children well and the host was very responsive. it had all the amenities we would need. we spent most of our time out and about but it had a lovely homey feel to it. Thankyou, we would stay again.\nThanks Kathleen for accommodating us and attending to our queries promptly! The neighborhood is lovely and it was really easy to access Birchgrove Oval for the fireworks so would definitely recommend the location and place to others looking to watch the fireworks :) <br\/>Thanks again for having us!\nOur family had the pleasure of renting Kathleen\u2019s house in Birchgrove over Christmas, and it was the perfect holiday inner city destination. The home was spacious and equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br\/>The location was great\u2014nestled in a quiet street next to a large park, yet close enough to the waterfront to enjoy scenic walks and gorgeous views. The kitchen was well equipped and the outdoor space provided a lovely spot for family gatherings. Our only suggestion was that the lawn could have been mowed and the yard cleaned with a blower. <br\/>Kathleen was very responsive to my questions and ensured the house was spotless and ready for us and we had all the info we needed to get in on arrival.<br\/>We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better place to celebrate Christmas, and we\u2019d happily return for another stay. Highly recommend!\nCame all the way from the US, and obviously things will be different here, A\/C limited to one room so hard to keep cool, there were fans but only two! We managed! I personally really enjoyed walking everywhere! Discovered a favorite place for coffee\u2026Charlotte! Such a great place and after being there for a week, they knew my order! \ud83d\ude04! Went to the Dawn Fraser pools, visited Darling Street frequently!! Really enjoyed 1 Rose in Balmain, Kathleen is a great host!!\nFantastic house for a family wedding in the city <br\/>Plenty of PT options and parks galore to take my granddaughter <br\/>Easy walking around and a great base for all activities <br\/>Off street parking was a bonus <br\/>Good coffee options <br\/>I\u2019d highly recommend staying here and such a beautiful part of Sydney\nWe had such an incredible stay at this property. Five nights with 4 adults and 2 kids. We were walking distance to the ferry and the park just over the side fence was so handy. Lovely coffee from across the street too. Kathleen was incredible and responsive with local suggestions and made sure we were immediately ready to settle in with staples in the fridge and cupboard. Plus books and games for the kids! Beds and pillows are comfy and it\u2019s a really quiet, safe area. Highly recommend!!!\nLovely, homely and clean space. My family was visiting Sydney from Singapore and needed to stay near family in the Birchgrove area, this was perfect for that.\nThoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location is perfect and the home well equipped, well presented and love the new kitchen makeover.  Kathleen is very responsive and helpful.\nBeautiful old house in a friendly area lots of dog walks\nEnjoyed the place very much. Kathleen was very kind and helped out a lot during my stay.\nKathleen was a great host. Place was exactly as described. I booked it for my family to visit me and it suited their requirements perfectly. <br\/>Easy access to 2 ferries! <br\/>Off street parking provided is a must in this area if you\u2019re driving. <br\/>Will book again! <br\/>Thanks Kathleen!\nGreat little house in the middle of Sydney.  Cosy house filled with light.  Great access to the ferries of Sydney.\nThe location is beautiful and it\u2019s a very family friendly set up. Great facilities. Thank you."}

Rooms are small, better for max 2 adults and maybe 1-2 kids. I wish there were wall plugs by the beds. Unit was out of coffee and host never responded to that request.<br\/>Worst was there was construction being done on the building that was VERY loud and started very early in the morning. It made for a generally uncomfortable stay.\nThis was the best Airbnb I\u2019ve ever stayed in. So cute, perfect location, and really well maintained. And check-in was so easy for us\u2026we were met at the building to have keys delivered. We will be back!\nGreat location, very convenient, Contemporary Hotels were easy to deal with & very helpful.\nGreat location in Darlinghurst, walking distance to everything and a beautiful apartment. Lift in the building is very, very old which made getting in and out with a baby & pram etc a bit laboursome but otherwise everything was great. Would recommend for those wanting to be in the midst of it all in Sydney.\nWe could not fault the apartment, location and assistance. Will definitely be back. Thank you!\nLovely, small apartment. Nicely furnished, comfortable. Very close to St Vincent\u2019s Private Hospital, coffee shops, public transport, Oxford St. Second bedroom has a double bed pushed up against a wall so that and the one bathroom made it not so ideal for two adult couples.\nCute and well appointed apartment within walking distance of shops and restaurants.  Nice appliances and quiet space on the top floor of the building with peace and quiet and a nice view from the balcony.\nGreat location, in the heart of things. v walkable to galleries, botanical gardens, opera house, stores. lots of fun cafes all around. apartment v tastefully decorated, and well stocked. kitchen amenities are top notch. Angela our concierge was super friendly and hospitable also v flexible when our flight was delayed. (Jetstar...the worst airline!!) I thoroughly recommend this as a great place to stay.\nIncredible find. Felt like a local right away. Charming building with an old elevator, and the cute apartment - perfect for a couple with a kid - felt newly renovated with so much light and a fantastic breeze and a lovely small balcony for the two of us to have our morning coffee. Nice neighborhood as well, with many dining and coffee options around the corner or a quick 5-10 min walk away. Check-in and out was super easy. Felt so great there. Would definitely return.\nOur hosts were so lovely and communicated with us throughout the whole stay. The apartment is clean, cute, cozy, has a balcony and so close to everything like cafes, shops and the gym is a 5 minute walk near by. Be sure to check out the amazing antique shop around the corner!! Definitely recommend and would stay again. 5 stars all the way!\nThe apartment is absolutely what you see what you get. It\u2019s so greatly presented in such a great spot in Darlinghurst, close walk (less than 4mins) to Oxford St. The entire stay was amazing and I cannot wait to come back again!\nBeautiful charming apartment in a great area.

She was wonderful to deal with and was so helpful and flexible with our check in. Thanks heaps.\nWe had a fantastic stay at Chantals! Highly recommend for kids.. The pool is great (not heated but lovely on a hot day) and they loved the skate ramp and trampoline. There were also lots of toys and books inside for rainy mornings, probably the best set up airbnb we've stayed in for kids. Location is great, a short walk to beach and also to the park and outdoor Cafe and close to walks etc. Chantals communication was fantastic and very responsive.

Chantal was very communicative and let us know how to contact her if needed. Would definitely book again.\nWe had a wonderful stay at Chantel's place in Kurnell. The house worked brilliantly, beds super comfy and the kids loved both the front and back yards. We also enjoyed exploring the local area, it's great for families. We would love to stay again on our next trip.\nWe had such a great time staying at this house. The owners made it so easy with notes on the fridge and with their communication and flexibility with check in and check out times. If your searching for a house that has plenty of entertaining and in a great location near the beach in a nice quiet neighbourhood then this is the one.\nWe enjoyed every minute of the week we spent at Chantal\u2019s family home. From her thoughtful communication ahead of time, flexibility on check-in and check-out, and wonderfully appointed and clean home, it was a really wonderful week. There was plenty of space for us and our 3 kids to relax, tire the kids out (in the pool and on the trampoline) and even for my wife and I to do some work on the two desks. A short walk to the beach and a great spot to explore Kurnell. Highly recommended!\nThis place was amazing for the family. More kid friendly than our own home haha \ud83d\ude02 amazing communication from host. Highly recommend!

Would definitely recommend Chantal\u2019s place particularly if wanting to entertain the kids.\nChantal\u2019s place is the perfect place for a young family to holiday- there\u2019s a great pool, trampoline and so many games for the kids to play inside.

{"listing_id":30276160,"comments":"If you value cleanliness, please do not bother booking.<br\/>Ad shows cluttered home and mentions animals but neglects to mention how unclean the property is.<br\/>Very uncomfortable experience, was unable to find affordable alternate accommodation and Airbnb took days to offer a resolution, so I had to stay but showered at my gym as the bug dropping and cobwebs made me very uncomfortable.<br\/>Home had a smell of cigarettes and animal droppings. The toilet had faeces in it when I first arrived and upon entering the home the first view is of bird droppings on the floor.<br\/>I have cats at home but do not have a kitty litter next to the toilet like at this property, and it is not shown in the photos either.<br\/>If you are okay with uncleanliness (which it seems a lot of the reviewers must have been) then it is affordable and has AC. Lynette was also a nice host, but the lack of hygiene was honestly disturbing.\nVery good stay experience. Lynette is very friendly. Quiet neighborhood, comfortable accommodation. The house has everything. The kitchen provides many condiments and I enjoyed my stay\u3002\nHad a great 5-week stay here. No complaints at all, nice little cosy space with everything required.\nThanks for providing me a home for a few nights and being an excellent communicator. the place was definitely worth the money.\nLynette is friendly and nice, the price is good \ud83d\udc4d\nLynette is a proactive host. The area was nice and clean. Great value, exactly what I was looking for.\nGreat place to spend a few nights on a budget.

Lynette makes one feel comfortable from the start. Provides everything required by guest (beverages etc). Good value for money. Cheers\nThank you Lynette for your friendliness and hospitality.\nI had a pleasant stay at this AirBnb with Lynette. She's very kind and helpful. The place was tidy and clean, which I really appreciated. The only downside was the strong smell of incense, which caused my nose to get blocked. Other than that, it was a great experience.\nLynette was friendly and understood my needs during my stay\nI stayed for almost a month and I felt right at home. Lynette was approachable and the room was cosy with heating and air conditioning. Check in was extremely flexible and I need only communicate with her shortly after I had landed in the morning to arrange the time. Lynette would also offer to change the sheets and one can appreciate clean sheets and linens on a regular basis. Also she had pet cats and birds as per description and we cosied right up to each other shortly after I arrived. For the month I was there, I never felt uncomfortable nor worried for my personal safety. This is very important to me as i had just moved to the country for work. Lynette would often be around in the living room and sometimes I would sit there with her and we would watch TV together. Like I said, I felt right at home, never a stranger. Thanks for having me, Lynette! Also note forgetting Joel, Lynette's co-host, who helped me get settled in when I arrived for check in. Thanks, Joel!\nGreat cozy spot out in the cute suburbs, and very welcoming and kind host. Felt right at home \u263a\ufe0f"}

Access to the CBD is relatively quick and easy by nearby buses.  The room is large and airy but visitors should be aware that the bedroom is upstairs and the sgared bathroom and toilet is downstairs.  As noted clearly in the listing, there is also no WIFI access or a washing machine which may be an issue for those longer stays.

Would stay again!\nNuestra estancia en Redfern fue genial, Daniel y Anna fueron muy atentos y serviciales e incluso nos dejaron hacer un checkout tarde para as\u00ed poder explorar la ciudad durante m\u00e1s tiempo. La ubicaci\u00f3n perfecta, y el estudio c\u00f3modo y acogedor, por nuestra parte no tuvimos ning\u00fan inconveniente. Muy recomendado !!\nI enjoyed my stay at Daniel\u2019s. The location was so perfect and convenient and the space was clean and pleasant.\nVery good location, close from bus stations but also good location if you like to walk <br\/>Clean place\nSuper cute place! Definitely small for two people but worth it if you don\u2019t mind being so cozy\nThe bed and the shower were great and its in a great location. Close to the light rail which made it very easy to get around. <br\/>A bit cramped on a wet weekend when we couldn't use the outdoor table, but fine for 2 people.\nA rather small but cozy Apartment,  perfect for solo travelling. The Caf\u00e9 at the corner (good ways) has definitly one of the best coffees. A must try, as well as the sandwiches and sweets. Vatious bus stops are  very close. A place to recommend.\nFabulous boltholt, close to many things -\nGreat location, laundromat is around the corner, bars and restaurants. Walkable to the city centre\nWe had a great stay here! The place was definitely small, but very comfortable and with all the amenities to ensure a cozy and convenient stay. The hosts warned us that, as they have young children in the adjacent house, it could be loud, but this was not a problem at all. The space was very quiet and peaceful and private, but I do appreciate the transparency of the hosts. All in all, a cute place in a great location.\nI stayed at Dan and Anna\u2019s for a few weeks. They are great, very accommodating and responsive. Their place has all amenities that you may need despite the fact that it is small. Very well connected to the rest of Sydney! Had a great time :)\nEnjoyed the studio and the neighborhood! Anna and Daniel are great hosts.\nThe location is very convenient; you can walk to the train, cbd and Surrey Hills. The one major drawback is the noise - though the host mentions thin walls and young kids it really doesn't properly communicate how loud the property is.<br\/>The room is more of a converted bedroom and it is really like living with the family. If you leave before 8am and come home after 9pm you'll be fine but if you're home while the family is awake it is noisy.<br\/> Also the wifi is poor, I wasn't able to work from the airbnb and had to go into the office every day. But the price is right.\nA cute little place to stay in a fantastic location. The room is equipped with everything you need for a short stay, and for longer stays, nothing is more than a quick commute away. There is no fan or air conditioning in the studio, so when the Sydney sun is shining it can get a bit warm inside, but it wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for me! Thanks Dan & Anna!\nExcellent location - close to many beautiful coffee places and bars in Surry Hills. The studio is well decorated and there is everything you will need. Also Daniel is very fast in responding. I enjoyed my stay, thank you so much!"}

It was a treat to stay in such a relaxing place! Thank you Marcelle & Peter!\nIt was a pleasant to stay with Marcelle and Peter. They are super friendly and always there if we need any help.

Excellent and helpful hosts from the moment I booked. Beautiful house in a great location from which to explore Sydney. Will definitely book again next time I\u2019m in Sydney.\nWhat a gem!

You don't get many places like that!<br\/>The hosts were super friendly, I had a great stay.\neverything was great, thank's a lot! :)\nMijn verblijf in het ontzettend sfeervolle huis van Marcelle & Peter omschrijft zich het beste als \u2018home away from home\u2019. De kamers zijn smaakvol en sfeervol en de gastheer en gastvrouw zijn vriendelijk en oprecht belangstellend naar je dag of je plannen zonder dat dit gedwongen of opdringerig voelt - ze geven ook veel ruimte voor privacy. <br\/>De buurt is levendig en komt in de avond helemaal tot leven wanneer de vele restaurants volstromen. Ik heb echt heerlijk gegeten. Dank voor jullie gastvrijheid! Ik heb enorm genoten van mijn verblijf bij jullie.\nWhat a lovely couple to be your first experience of Sydney and Australia. They're very friendly and made me feel right at home. We chatted about our world travels and Aussie culture. I couldn't recommend them enough.\nMarcelle and Peter were great hosts and it was a pleasure staying with them for one month. They have a very lovely home and are very kind people, happy to help in any way they can.  <br\/>Everything was very clean as well. My room had a very comfy bed, the room was simple but sufficient for me - if you are staying longer, I would recommend to book one of the other two rooms (they have several rooms on AirBNB), which have more storage space. The house is located very close to Newtown with plenty of bars and restaurants, and a great alternative vibe. There's also a good bus connection to the University.  Thank you for a great time, Marcel and Peter!\nI had stayed there for one month and I can honestly recommended it. The place is very clean, which I appreciate a lot, and looks exactly as on the photos. It is very close to busy Newtown, but it is very calm. Very close to bus stop. Hosts are very friendly, but also give you a space. Everything what you need is in the house.

Getting in was so simple <br\/>Emanuel was easy to communicate with.\nThe property is in a great location and is very tidy . We enjoyed our stay and found the hosts to be accommodating and would recommend this property to couples or small families .\nGreat place to stay for 5 weeks, Manuel was very helpful with anything we needed. Would recommend to a friend.\nNice host and easy to communicate with.\nI had a great stay at Emanuel\u2019s place for three months. The apartment is comfortable and well-maintained, and Emanuel was a very responsive and helpful host. One thing to note is that the apartment is close to a busy street, so it can be a bit noisy for some. However, the location is excellent, being just a 6-7 minute walk from the train station, making it very convenient for trips to Sydney city centre. Overall, a wonderful place to stay!\nEverything needed for a brief, work-related stay in Sydney. A safe, spacious, bright open unit. <br\/>Emanuel was responsive and accommodating to my changing needs.\n\u9664\u4e86\u79bb\u8def\u8fb9\u6709\u70b9\u8fd1\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf.\u5e72\u51c0\u536b\u751f\nThis place was beautiful, exactly like the photos but had  few inconveniences;<br\/>Traffic noise was strong, I kept waking up throughout the night. I slept in the lounge area which seemed to be worse than the bedroom as my kids slept in the room and they didn\u2019t wake up at night. <br\/>Also, the hot water cylinder was  enough for only 1 person and there were 4 of us so that was annoying we had to stagger  our shower times <br\/>Lastly, the stairs were  difficult especially with young kids and a stroller. <br\/>Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s clean and value for money in this time of the year.\nEmanuel was a very kind, responsive host and the place was great. Very clean and spacious living. Good location along the airport line with many places to eat on the main road. Would definitely stay again!\nPerfect location for visiting nearby family\nVery nice host and easy to talk to! Slightly noisy through the night as close to a busy road, but apartment was spacious and very clean and comfortable!\nWe loved the apartment and what we liked most is the large parking lot for our 4WD, since finding something like that in Sydney is very difficult! Super recommended!\nEmanuel has a beautiful apartment and everything is in pristine condition. It was a great advantage to have a secure car parking space. The location was good with easy access to public transport and although we were aware of the noise issues being so close to a main road and junction, it sounded like the windows were open. The apartment would benefit greatly from double glazing but noise issues aside, we would definitely stay here again.\nGreat value for the location <br\/>Close to all amenities with access to main roads & highways including the airport! Several shopping malls within 5kms distance <br\/>This apartment is spacious & also is located on the 2nd floor so some stairs to climb with luggage to be considered.<br\/>If you\u2019re a light sleeper best pack some ear plugs as the traffic can be noisey otherwise great stay"}

The place also has an awesome rooftop pool\nGreat spot in Manly\nVery nice accommodation with a beautiful view to the beach\nReally enjoyed staying here.  Fantastic view.  Great location.  Clean space.  Would stay there again for sure.\nAn excellent apartment in a superb location, and what an incredible view from the front room and balcony, with daily visits from friendly Cockatoos. Would highly recommend!\nNicely decorated, cozy and central place. Light and airy with a well equipped kitchen and nice living room area. Sandra the host has always been very quick in responding and tried to always accommodate our wishes and needs as best as she could! And the view is great, as well!\nDie Lage der Wohnung ist ausgezeichnet. Leider liess die Sauberkeit sehr zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und die Unterkunft ist sehr in die Jahre gekommen. Das Bett war schmutzig und die K\u00fcche war schmutzig und verdreckt so dass nach unserer Ankunft eine Generalreinigung vorgenommen werden musste, da wir unter diesen Umst\u00e4nden die Wohnung nicht beziehen wollten. Sandra und ihr Partner waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.\nFantastic location and Jady so helpful .\nSandras place was amazing - so incredibly close to everything for exploring all the area has to offer.

Es hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Perfekt f\u00fcr zwei Personen.\nSandra\u2019s place was perfect for our week in Manly. So close to the beach, wonderful cafes, and the ferry, and a proper kitchen for self catering. The views from the balcony are spectacular, and we even had regular visits from the cockatoos! I would definitely recommend to any couple who loves the beach."}
{"listing_id":32095400,"comments":"So generous of Vicki and Tim to share their own home with all their books and the lovely terrace. The place is both spacious and cosy, and located in a lovely part of Sydney! Parking was free and very easy. As it is their own home it is 'lived in' and isn't spotlessly clean and tidy like a rental-only property. But that comes with the benefit of being charming and very well stocked!\nComfortable home, great location for exploring Sydney, easy walk to shops and restaurants, great outdoor patio, plenty of books to read, undercover off street parking . Great place to relax and feel at home.\nGreat Location and lots of space to relax. <br\/>we loved staying here\nWe easily settled into this comfortable cottage for a couple of weeks. It was clearly the owner's place of residence, rather than a 'holiday rental', so it felt like we were staying in the home of a friend. Great location on the north shore, plenty of walking trails and close to good shopping and restaurants.\nGreat 2 week stay at Tim and Vicki\u2019s lovely house. Perfect location for CBD, beaches and exploring NSW.\nTim and Vicki's place is a home away from home, literally. Very comfortable and spacious for a one bedroom Airbnb. It's in a great location, quiet with a nice outlook but conveniently close to supermarkets and plenty of restaurants. Great facilities and amenities.\nWe enjoyed our stay in this comfortable cottage . <br\/>Nice and warm with the heating . <br\/>Lovely bed and all the comforts of home .\nWe had an absolutely wonderful time at Tim and Vicki\u2019s place. By far the best AirBnb experience we have ever had. A home away from home with all the ammenities one could want. The location is great with great walks and easy access to public travel to the city and elsewhere. Exceptional. Highly recommended.\nA cosy old fashioned semi with central heating which is needed in winter as it is drafty without it. .This is the owners own house and they vacate while you visit . Very comfy bed in a moderately sized room and a combined lounge , dining and kitchen small and compact. Nice terrace which would be great if it was warm. A good uphill walk to Cremorne or Neutral Bay shops, going home is much easier. Off street parking a bonus. Easy communication with owners with flexible checking\/out. Would happily revisit\nTim and Vicki were easy and friendly to communicate with and very responsive.  The house is in a lovely location that feels really private and quiet yet still close to amenities and transport to anywhere.  We stayed on this side of Cremorne while waiting for our apartment to become available and  enjoyed some Bush walking in the local area that we had never experienced before.  Thanks for allowing us to stay.\nSuch a comfortable, well appointed, clean and light filled home in which to see a beautiful part of Sydney. Fabulously situated near everything, but still quiet enough to enjoy a wine and solitude on the fabulous outside patio.\nLovely comfy family home. Thank you Tim and Vicky for all your thoughtfulness, good communication and understanding when we thought at one point we would need to cancel ( visas in time of COVID not easy)<br\/>Lovely quiet neighbourhood with excellent shopping, cafes and fabulous beach nearby. We have no hesitation in recommending Tim and Vicki\u2019s home.\nWhat you see is what you get: it's exactly as it appears in the pictures. A delightful, north-facing home set in one of the most wonderful parts of Sydney. For me, it was a haven as Sydney emerged from lockdown, but for tourists it makes the perfect home base from which to explore the city.<br\/>I can't say enough about this place: the sunny terrace is perfect for passing the day away overlooking the gorgeous north shore, the kitchen is full-featured and the living room is bright and tranquil. The bedroom is whisper-quiet, and the back garden is a lovely spot to sit and have a cup of coffee while the birds sing.<br\/>It was important to me that the place had a washer and dryer. The washer is gigantic. I barely used the dryer because I preferred to dry my clothes on the clothesline in the backyard.<br\/>Added bonuses include the carport (though street parking is unmetered and always in supply) and the relaxing bathtub. <br\/>Walking around the area is a real pleasure, and there's a million restaurants, cafes, bars and shops just a stone's throw away. Personally I prefer having a car in Cremorne, but it's not a necessity.<br\/>Tim and Vicki were particularly hospitable. They always made themselves available, and they are just a couple of intelligent, engaging, kind people (with a great bookshelf!)<br\/>Heartily recommend.\nI had a wonderful stay at Tim and Vicki's. They welcomed me into their home and would love to stay here again in the future\nThis is a lovely home, very comfortable, bright and sunny, and well located. We really enjoyed ourselves, and will certainly stay again when we can."}

The hosts were really helpful in keeping our bags safe whilst we explored the city either side of check in\nGreat affordable spot in the middle of pots points. Stylish with everything we needed for our stay. Be aware, there are few stairs, depending on what floor you are on, we were on the third, which was fine, but a decent climb. Location was great, wander down to the markets one way, or the waterfront the other. We would stay here again.\nAbbiamo soggiornato 2 notti in questo albergo, il prezzo \u00e8 molto conveniente e rispecchia totalmente quello che viene offerto. Le camere sono piccole, ma ordinate e pulite. <br\/>L\u2019albergo \u00e8 una struttura stretta che si sviluppa in altezza.

We were able to drop bags off early before check in and were well informed of options in the area.<br\/>This is a small family owned establishment. Before moving to Europe I lived in the area and the location is awesome. Stairs might not be for you if you have mobility issues, but i will stay again!\nAmazing location.

I found the service aspect quite poor. The contact person did not respond on two occasions to my phone calls and the receptionist was not what you would call friendly.- just going through the motions.\nIt was a great stay at the Maisonette and we really appreciated the tips for local restaurants, places to visit and how to get there.\ngreat value and good position for our concert at the Opera House\nGreat location. Lovely restaurants felt very much at home not overly crowded with locals rather than tourists so would definitely stay here again. We stayed in the room with 2 single beds my only negative here would be having a shower with a curtain is always a battle trying to keep water off the entire bathroom floor but otherwise really good. The hosts both days were fantastic and happy to chat about the local area.\nWe had an enjoyable stay at the Maisonette. While small, the room was comfortable with good beds, air conditioning, and reliable wifi. The reception team were very helpful and even let us check in early. The only real downside is that they don\u2019t service your room if you\u2019re only staying a few nights. They also don\u2019t provide hand towels or face towels which was a pain, but were happy to provide us with fresh bath towels upon request. A good experience overall \ud83d\ude0a"}

The space has all the amenities, the kitchen is fairly small \/ within the bathroom, but as described. Would be well suited to people on holiday \/ short term stays. <br\/>The location is well connected with buses and about a 20 minute walk to Coogee beach\nThe room was perfect for my 2-week stay.

The space was clean, cozy, perfect for my stay.<br\/>The location was ideal, with easy access to Coogee beach which is walking distance away. <br\/>Overall, my experience was great, . Thank you both!\nWe had a great stay here for a week, exactly what we wanted! Janet was lovely and very welcoming on our arrival. We had our privacy and Janet was responsive with any messages we asked. Would stay here again \ud83d\ude0a\nHad a lovely stay here for nearly 3 weeks. The location is perfect, within walking distance to public transport into the city, 15mins walk to Coogee centre and the beach. The room is lovely and spacious and the bed is very comfortable. An ideal stay for 1-2 guests on a short term basis. Comes equipped with basic cooking facilities, a washing machine, dryer, iron and fridge. The only negative was that the accommodation was advertised as a \u2018private room\u2019 and the hosts would come in to use the washing machine\/ dryer (granted Janet would text first before entering). Janet was lovely though, very warm and friendly! Would recommend.\nHad a great stay at Janet\u2019s. Such a perfect space that is close to shops, the beach and has many bus lines close by. Super private and relatively quiet (sometimes can hear people walking around and talking upstairs) which made me feel safe and comfortable\nLovely large room, nice & private with its own entrance. I stayed for 2 weeks & felt at home. Janet was very friendly & helpful.\nThe room is very spacious and comes with a big double bed, TV, fridge, toaster, kettle and microwave. It is in an ideal location to get to coogee beach and bars\/restaurants. The bus also stops at the end of the road which makes it easy to get to the city\/ bondi junction. <br\/>As you are in someone\u2019s family home, the noise travels quite clearly from upstairs and when the family are outside. The noise and footsteps is especially loud early in the morning and in the evening. The host regularly uses the washing machine and dryer which is located in your private space but does message before entering. <br\/>One thing to note is the room can get quite damp. The room does not really suit cooking your own food so it suits a shorter term stay. <br\/> <br\/>We stayed for 10 days and it is reasonably priced compared to the other options in the area.\nHad such a lovely stay here, looked exactly like the photos and we felt right at home. Room was clean and was a decent enough sized space. Such an ideal location as you are very close to Coogee for restaurants and the beach. Would definitely stay here again :)\nGreat location, would be happy to recommend Janet as a host and would be happy to return a third time!\nThis was a lovely stay. Janet was a great host\nAccommodation was good for a short stay. Quite dark inside. Very comfortable bed and good to have Netflix. About a 20 minute walk to beach. Close to local bus stops.. Not really convenient for cooking as the area is quite compact.  As the studio is attached to main house, noise from upstairs travels easily. Overall good value and Janet was very kind and responsive.\nAmazing host and amazing location for visiting Eastern Sydney. We\u2019ll set up for one person, and Janet and Stuart are so friendly and helpful with anything I needed! Thank you!\nThis place was perfect for what I needed.

Very relaxing being in the trees and nature. It is a wonderful location, right next to the water for flat water paddling \/ stand up paddle boarding \/ swimming.

Mia was very helpful in directions and suggestions on activities to do. The place itself was clean, cosy and perfect for what we wanted. The fact that there is no television in the place made us be more active and exploring. Bathtub was also an amazing experience.<br\/>Would definitely stay there again!\nThe place was very nice, however it was cold and the heather was not available. I asked the host about it and she told me that the heather or heating system was not available in Summer due do maintenance. It was a very cold night and  morning. <br\/>The structure of the tent was very unique, however due to the tent be next to a driveway, every time a car came in or out the noise was loud, what can be disturbing if what you are looking for is an immersive experience with the nature and surroundings.<br\/>The bath was good and inside the tent. The shower was outside and due to the cold weather we were not able to use it.\nBeautiful space, very comfy, great views!\nWhat a lovely space! Beautifully decorated, convenient location in walking distance to shops, bay and activities. Even though it's residential, you can still meld into nature completely. <br\/>Better for those who can easily walk up the steep driveway with bags and shower either outdoors or use the beautiful bath.<br\/>Definitely would recommend as a romantic getaway where you can dissolve into natural surroundings whilst close to local amenities.\nWas such a lovely place! Exactly as Mia described. Very relaxing and can hear lots of wildlife at night. Only downfall is it\u2019s very difficult to get into. The stairway is rather difficult especially at night or with luggage. Otherwise, I recommend!\nSecond time staying and it was just as amazing as the first experience. <br\/>Beautiful views, great location, huge bathtub and very comfortable bed.

Kylie was great when organising the accommodation and happily (and quickly) answered any questions we had prior to booking.  It's also bigger than it looks."}

Fully stocked kitchen, excellent coffeemaker, comfortable bed, nice shower.  Could occasionally hear traffic noise at night, but we did not find it bothersome.  Communication with Julie was quick and easy.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.\nthis was our second stay and just as great as the first time. felt like a second home. we will be back!\nOverall it was a good deal for the money, the place had everything that I could need. The place has a great place and it is easy to walk downtown and to nice restaurants\/bars. There was some noise from the street but it is never at a level that disturbs you. The AC works well but it is a bit loud while working. The only down side is the place is completely covered in carpets which is hard to clean and collects dust, although the cleaner has done her best to clean. The place was clean overall.\nSuper convenient and comfortable place. Clean and come with lotsa amenities. Julie very helpful and friendly too!\nGreat central location with easy access to public transportation. <br\/>Very convenient for groceries and restaurants.\nI stayed here for two months and found my stay to be comfortable and convenient.

The pictures don\u2019t do the view justice.\nVery nice place, would definitely recommend.\nWe booked Fred\u2019s place specifically for the view of the fireworks on NYE - the view does not disappoint.  There\u2019s a large terrace shared with only 3 other units so didn\u2019t have to worry about crowds or a long day of waiting.  The view is spectacular.  The unit itself is nothing fancy - very basic but it served its purpose.  We had parking permits for the street which we pretty much found a spot and left the car there (you don\u2019t need a car with this location).  Great neighborhood restaurants nearby and the train and ferry are very close.  I go back and forth with the value considering the basic apartment and building is older but ultimately would say it\u2019s worth it for this iconic view.\nL\u2019appartement est spacieux, la terrasse est sublime.<br\/>L\u2019emplacement est id\u00e9al: tout est \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 (restaurants, acc\u00e8s au pont, acc\u00e8s aux bateaux bus\u2026)\nmillion dollar view.\nFabulous location, convenient to CBD\nLoved staying at this location and will go back in 2026 when return to Sydney.

The view from the terrace is amazing.\nThe view from the terrace was absolutely stunning, however the rest was far from expectations. The apartment was mouldy and smelled mouldy and dusty, and it definitely needs a refresh. The floor wasn't clean, there was a lot of dirt. <br\/>The bathroom is extremely small and access to the sink is limited due to its size.

Et bien s\u00fbr, la vue le jour, la vue la nuit... extra.\nKirribilli is the ideal location for ferrying around Sydney Harbour. This comfortable, clean, quiet<br\/>apartment is a quick walk under the Jacaranda trees (in full bloom in October) to the ferry terminal, lots<br\/>of cafes, restaurants, and services within blocks. Experience the harbour activity, take in the spectacular<br\/>view of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge right from the balcony or a 6 minute ferry to<br\/>Circular Quays, the hub of activity in the City. We visited Sydney for 8 amazing days from Canada and<br\/>highly recommend staying in the beautiful Kirribilli neighbourhood and Fred\u2019s place for easy access to all<br\/>amenities.

Has all needed amenities and bathroom is everything you need. Location is good, short walk to train station and Chatswood shops and surrounding precincts, restaurants and all shopping you want. Check out Grace's place if you can. Highly recommend.\nVery comfortable and well appointed, this flat is excellently located between Roseville and Chatswood. We were very happy to find it also was extremely clean. The sofa bed may be more suitable for a short stay or kids. For two people, it was perfect for our stay and Grace is very easy to communicate with! Thank you Grace!\nGreat place, gracious host, convenient location!\nSecond stay, feel like home as always!\nVery great place, easy from Roseville station and easy walk to chatswood center. Very clean and well organised. Grace are nice people and helpful.\nExtremely clean, tidy and lovely flat. Everything is well designed and well laid out.<br\/>The location is also great. Quiet but convenient, close to train station, shopping centers and everything.<br\/>Grace is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She is quick at responding and always willing to help. Didn\u2019t find a proper long term accommodation upset me, but staying with Grace made me feel just like home.<br\/>It was an amazing and unexpected journey that I will never forget.\nWe had a great week at Grace\u2018s place. It was very private and extremely clean and we felt very safe. We could walk to both Roseville and Chatswood stations so it was very easy to get into the city. There are some great cafes at Roseville station so we could start every day with an excellent coffee. Grace was quick to respond and extremely kind.\nA well maintained cozy self contained place, easy walking distance to the train station. Roseville and Chatswood trains run very frequently. Chatswood is good for grocery shopping.  Easy parking.\nThe stand-alone house is at the back of the property is new and very clean. (Being a no shoes home helps). It is well equipped with dish and clothes washing machines and even a second microwave oven. <br\/>The house is not cluttered with supplies and as we were here for several days we visited the local supermarket for toilet paper, rubbish bags, soap, dish powder and laundry liquid. You might want to bring some cutlery as only a set of three is provided.<br\/>The air conditioner is excellent. The shower is fantastic. Optus Internet works reliably and gets 50\/20Mbps. A second key was not available which was a pity. Two towels are provided but a hand towel would be nice. Parking out front fairly close by is no problem.<br\/>Grace was very welcoming and the location is convenient. Chickens can be heard near by which is very sweet. Overall, good value."}
{"listing_id":35581459,"comments":"Had a great stay. Perfectly set up for a family with young kids. Plenty of books and toys as well as the pool and spa kept us all entertained for the week, despite some poor weather. Airbnb at its best, with a family opening up their home for others to respectfully use.\nLovely place and local beaches were excellent, rock pools were great with kids <br\/>Loved the pool and spa.\nGreat holiday home for our family with four young kids. Shops and beach all easy to walk to. Really enjoyable experience\nA slice of the great Australian dream! We live in an apartment in the desert, so having a big backyard for the kids to play and an open kitchen and lounge with a gas fireplace was heaven for us. It's so close to the shops and our family and friends, so we had an amazing week there.<br\/>The bedrooms were spacious and cosy.

{"listing_id":35620144,"comments":"Our stay was perfect, amazing location and the apartment had everything we needed <br\/>We will definitely stay here again\nnice place quite close to beach and local restaurants,  easy neighbourhood\nWe were very appreciative to find this lovely little apartment available after the previous hosts cancelled on us at the last minute. Not what we had originally planned but the apartment was delightful and in an amazing location. We didn\u2019t use the rooftop as it was a little too windy. It was easy to just relax in the living room enjoying the veiw and the waves.\nA great place to stay when you want easy aaccess to the beaches, walks and cafes. you feel part of the community.\nThe hosts were great communicators and the location was fantastic. We had issues with the main bedroom light not turning off with the remote and the other bedroom light not turning on. Overall a great experience that I\u2019d definitely recommend!\nPerfect location, lovely clean property and the rooftop views were incredible! Perfect bondi location, would highly recommend \u263a\ufe0f\nGreat location\nGreat spot easy access\nSuper location. A great spot for people watching, whale spotting, nipping to the beach for a swim or picking up a coffee in the morning. It\u2019s all there, just outside. One truly wet and windy horrid day was perfect for watching Netflix or the wild, wild  sea. A great little break, with a trip to Luna park on the way home.\nWhat a location! Did not need to book an Uber. Great space to relax.\nif you could give a location 10 stars, this would be it.

{"listing_id":35971790,"comments":"It is located a really good point near the harbor bridge and circular quay, and convenient to use transportation both metro and bus. <br\/>I recommend this room who wants to be a time traveler go back to late 70s or 80s because it's really old apartment which keeps interesting old style stuffs in it even though some of inconvenient. And this room could be a better place if host pays more attention to details like stained carpets, mosquitoes at the entrance, smells in old blankets and pillows (though their covers are newly provided). Anyhow my family enjoyed Sydney at this house. Appreciate to the host providing good location of house with affordable price.\nLocation and cleanliness were great however a wee welcome pack of milk and water would have been nice.\nAmazing location, close to everything, view amazing, clean and tidy home\nAwesome location, clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!\nThis was a fabulous place to stay<br\/>Very lucky to be this close to the city and have three beds!<br\/>Travelling with two teenage kids is never easy and this worked to treat<br\/>We were super lucky to be able to work with the host to drop our bags off early and be able to go out and explore the city while it was cleaned.<br\/>If you know what it\u2019s like to stay in Sydney, you would understand this is prime Realestate.<br\/>Loved staying and happy recommend to anyone\nBrilliantly located homely, but spacious, apartment. If walking from Barangaroo station there are quite a few steps to climb up to the level needed for the apartment as the lift isn't yet fully working. Very friendly hosts who were flexible with checking in & out times. Perfect for our family of 4 however the fridge is small, with an ice box that isn't that cold & there is no dishwasher so we stuck to simple meals that didn't require many ingredients or much washing up! Plenty of restaurants & bars within 5-10 mins walk in either Darling Harbour or Walsh Bay. The nearest food shop\/supermarket is a little further away, around a 15-20 min walk so be prepared (the one mentioned on the Airbnb listing is no longer open). Would definitely recommend.\nWe enjoy pur beautiful stay for the New Year firework with nice views and close to a lot of attractions. <br\/>We are very happy during our stay\nPhenomenal downtown location in Sydney in the The Rocks. Easily walkable to multiple restaurants and the transit system. Our host graciously accommodated an early luggage drop off. An older unit, but had everything we needed including air conditioning. One mechanical issue was that the oven did not work properly. Our host said they would investigate and have it repaired. Overall, we absolutely loved the location and it made our stay in Sydney fantastic!\nThis was an ideal location in Sydney! Perfect for 3 of us - but could easily do 4-5 people. We could walk everywhere and 5 min to the metro meant we were easy transport to everything in Sydney. The place had all the things we needed \/ two cute pubs within a block for evenings out, a nd the local swimming hole at the reserve was 5 min away. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better host or location!\nThe accommodation was beautiful, clean, and had everything we needed. The area was nice, and all the places we wanted to visit were within walking distance.\nGreat place within the city\n\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u8d8a\nWe stayed at Tracy's place for 2 months.  You can't beat this location!  It's an easy walk to the Rocks, CBD, Circular Quay and Barangaroo.  The New Metro is a 5 minute walk.  Local pub and restaurants were close and fun with good food and drink!  Tracy was very responsive to internet challenges.  Apartment provided just the basics and the mini refrigerator should be replaced by a full size refrigerator  or at least put on a stand to make it more accessible.   Bottom line...LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!\nLoved our stay at Tracy\u2019s place. Fantastic location, walking distance to major sites in Sydney Harbour. Easy access to plenty of restaurants and bars. Close to the metro. A very reasonable price for such a great location.  The apartment is old but very spacious and comfortable and the host is very responsive.\nThe housing is very good, the geographical location is excellent, the surrounding scenery is beautiful and the transportation is convenient."}

The area is great 5 minutes or so to the bus stop that takes you to the station to get into the centre.\nPros: <br\/>Pinky was a nice host.<br\/>Place was well kept & tidy.<br\/>It was spacious. <br\/>Rules were enforced on respectful behaviour with 10+ Airbnb guests also in the house. <br\/>Cons: <br\/>No heating or cooling in the house (fans only). <br\/>Insufficient supply of essentials. <br\/>30 minute walk to train station, but there are buses. <br\/>Quality of linen in bathrooms & bedrooms was ordinary.\nWe had the most wonderful stay at Pinky\u2019s! Although a little bit out of the centre, really accessible by the bus and metro, and in such a peaceful town. The facilities were even more clean and perfect than the photos - the communal areas had so much space to cook\/ use the l facilities. The bathroom was equally clean and the shower was soo lovely. The bed was also super comfortable and the room had lots of storage space. What made the stay so wonderful however was Pinky - the kindest host and always so smiley and willing to go above and beyond. She and her family do a wonderful job of running the place. Everyone in the house was so respectful thanks to Pinky making it so homely for everyone, and we were gutted we weren\u2019t staying longer to socialise with other tenants staying longer :)\nGreat place\ngood place to stay , closed to bus and traim station , clean place nice kichen great back yard\nGreat spot right next to the M91 bus that took me to nearby Padstow, Bankstown and then onward to Parramatta. A lovely home that was clean and felt homely. The area is residential so very quiet. Highly recommend!\nStaying at Pinky's place was a really enjoyable experience for me.<br\/>It helped make my stay in Sydney relaxing and worthwhile.\nNice and easy accessible\nThe Room was clean, pinky is very nice and friendly. Meet a lot of cool people in this house."}

The flat itself is beautiful with lots of character and has stunning views over the pacific ocean. We could easily commute into the city every day with frequent buses within 5 minutes walk. There is a Coles supermarket again within 5 minutes walk and other shops and restaurants in the same vicinity. We had no problems whatsoever with the apartment and Barry has been a very friendly and accommodating host. We couldn\u2019t have asked for better and we will very much miss living there!\nBarry's place is a beautiful hideout in Vaucluse. The space is full of charm with tasteful decoration, incredible natural light, new appliances and comfy beds. The location is awesome. 10 mins to the bay and 10 mins to dramatic cliff walks. There are busses going to the city, Bondi and the Junction all within a 5 min walk and the local shops are walkable and have everything you need. Barry has been a great host, responsive, kind and helpful."}
{"listing_id":36506833,"comments":"We chose this apartment at Mcmahons Point to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. It had all the benefits of staying in the Sydney CBD without being right there. Combined easy access to all places with a beautiful tranquil setting literally on the water with far more room than a hotel room. The apartment was well presented with all that we needed. We love the Blues Point road areas and we enjoyed being there.\nThat flat is in an excellent location, and is very private and quiet. What a beautiful view, and only a few steps from the ferry wharf. It's equipped with all the things you'll need for a comfortable stay (and for self catering).\nA lovely place to stay and MadeComfy were professional and very helpful\nThe apartment has a great view and location but is badly let down by the host agency, Made Comfy. They did respond to our request for assistance with a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm on arrival. Eventually we managed to sort out the problem ourselves with help from Airbnb in the US but it would have been easier and less stressful to have a helpful host on the ground. They also failed to respond to our request for extra blankets (we arrived in Sydney during a cold snap and there was only a thin doona on the bed). After having 3 emails ignored I rang Made Comfy\u2019s office and they said they\u2019d drop some blankets over that day. They later sent a message saying they didn\u2019t have any spare blankets and encouraged us to use the heater (we had been - it was still cold!)<br\/>Most troubling is their failure to respond to requests for help on arrival. What if the key didn\u2019t work? Would we still be waiting on the street?\n\u8fd9\u5957\u623f\u5b50\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u771f\u662f\u65e0\u53ef\u539a\u975e\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u51fa\u5165\u4e5f\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u5750\u8f6e\u6e21\u53bb\u54ea\u91cc\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u5feb\nFeels like a well loved home away in a secluded paradise, yet it\u2019s only minutes into the city - Walk to the ferry, train or in over the bridge.       <br\/>It is a kitchen of a passionate chef<br\/>Enjoy coffee, from the espresso or pod machine, out on the balcony where  the only sound is the lapping of the waves in the harbour.<br\/>The view is unbelievable!\nAs a regular it is still great.

Right in the heart of Sydney with surreal views of all the icons (from the front of the building) including the harbour bridge, opera house and centre point tower AND also secluded bay views from the bedroom and apartment in general!<br\/>Place was super Tidy and has ALOT of utensils to use! Was perfect!<br\/>Suggestions would be to install an aircon in the bedroom (there was a fan) and a bathroom fan for the toilet!<br\/>Apart from that, this place got my 5 stars!\nWow , wow, wow. Stayed in Sydney many times but never on this side of the harbour. Beautiful setting,  by the water. Will definitely stay here again . Close to ferry and amenities but totally secluded and peaceful , you\u2019d think you were on a beach in Thailand waking to the waves outside the bedroom windows on the small beach right next door.  If you like to cook , which I do, the kitchen is superbly equipped with everything you need. This is one of the most relaxing Airbnb\u2019s we\u2019ve stayed in\n3rd time at this place and still fantastic\nBeautiful apartment with the front overlooking the Harbour Bridge and Opera House, and the back looking onto a beautiful quiet part of the Harbour looking into Balmain. Easy walk into Milsons Point, Kirribilli and even The Rocks if you\u2019re up for a stroll, but plenty else to do within walking distance around Lavender Bay. My husband and I loved the tranquil so close to the City."}

Was lovely to be able to sit around the kitchen and cook meals together of a night and chill in the lounge just catching up<br\/>Morning visits from Mr Miyagi ( neighbours cat) was definitely a bonus.

Very convenient with the car space and laundry access. The apartment was fully stocked with everything that we needed - it\u2019s very quiet too.

However there are some drawbacks such as the portable aircons, they are weak, noisy, the curtains in the bedroom is barely there, couldnt stop any daylight! We couldnt sleep well due to these matters.\nStunning view of Bondi beach - you can easily sit by the living room window and enjoy that view for hours or go out to the beach and you\u2019re there in a few minutes.

{"listing_id":37368738,"comments":"A beautiful spot on the water in a quiet location with good walking access to the ferry. Very friendly hosts with a gorgeous dog. Some deterioration of jetty and outdoor decor compared to photos, but still a lovely spot to sit and enjoy the view.\nAmazing location! Loved being right on the water watching the harbour life go by. <br\/>Very easy access to accomodation felt like we had the place to ourselves. If you love fishing this is amazing, we sat on the private deck and caught a few fish. <br\/>Thank you so much Rachel x\nThe location of Rachel's place is absolutely stunning. We had lovely weather so sitting outside on the lounge watching the sunset was spectacular. <br\/>Rachel was excellent with communication and Brulee the Goldie is a little sweetheart.<br\/>Overall, a comfy stay in a perfect location.\nWe enjoyed our stay at Rachael's studio and boat house.<br\/>The views from the boat house and jetty were amazing.<br\/>The accommodations is clean and tidy with nice sized comfortable beds.<br\/>The bathroom area was clean and tidy however the access at night from the boat house accommodation needs improvement especially if it rains during the night.<br\/>The access to the accommodations was a little awkward as the stairway from the road was tight when carrying baggage, and may not suit everyone.<br\/>Walking to the ferry was easy with the terminal being at the end of the street, access to local pubs and restaurants were only a short walk away, and were listed in the accommodation guide.<br\/>Fortunately we are dog lovers as you share the garden area with a beautiful Labrador she was no trouble  at all.<br\/>Definitely enjoyed our stay at The boat house.\nThe rooms have a fantastic view over the harbour.\nWe enjoyed our stay at this lovely place. The location is great, only a short walk to ferry into <br\/>the city. It was really nice to relax on the jetty and enjoy the view. Rachel is a great host, <br\/>and her sweet dog, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, is adorable :)\nPossibly the best air bnb we have stayed in, absolutely stunning spot. Loved being sent off to sleep by the sound of the waves in the harbour and the gorgeous dog! Rachel was lovely, very accommodating and relaxed :)\nFantastic location, quiet and relaxing. Loved the convenience of a short walk to ferry stop into the city and nearby cafe and general store, just a few minutes walk. The waterfront park directly across the road is lovely. Bed was very comfortable and clean as were the bath towels. Kitchenette, overwater deck area and boathouse room were a bit more run down than it appeared in the listing photos but everything worked nicely and I wouldn't want this to deter anyone from staying at this great little spot.\nGreat location on the water, thankfully we had good weather\nPictures aren\u2019t really updated. Although the description is accurate, expect a more rustic feel of the place. Also, a golden retriever would share the lawn. So be ready to be welcomed by an energetic dog. Also note that the areas (bathroom, bedrooms etc) are all located outdoors.\nWow! Such and awesome place to have a little Sydney escape. We all absolutely LOVED the harbourside location. I don\u2019t think there is anything else like this experience! Kids had a ball fishing from the edge of the jetty. The location (literally across the road from beautiful Birchgrove Oval) can\u2019t be beaten! We picked fresh mulberries from a tree before paddling in the sandy beachfront with the Harbour bridge in the background. All just steps from the front door. <br\/>I have already recommended this unique experience to friends. Rachel was very relaxed and welcoming, a great host. Thank you for sharing your space with us!\nFantastic experience with wonderfully unique accommodation.\nWhat an absolute dream! This little oasis is a private escape, perfect for a relaxing staycation! The views are beautiful across the water, and the decking is perfect for a wine and cheese night, followed by smores on the fire! We used the kayaks, and it so surreal to paddle straight towards the harbour bridge! Such a perfect place and Rachel and the fanily are lovely, especially our new little furry friend! Definitely recommend!\ngreat spot to relax by the water and sit around a fire in the evening\nSuch a magical place! So grateful to have had Rachel and her family share it with us! So much to do, close to everything - we truly left refreshed and excited to return in the near future! Xx"}

The only downfall was not having aircon as it did get quite stuffy, but otherwise it had a washer, clean sheets, and it was a pleasant stay!!\nNice place overall and easy to access. I just wish it came with a ceiling fan at least and slightly better pillows but overall it\u2019s fantastic spot\ud83d\ude00\nNice little spot in a quiet part of Glebe with plenty of sunlight.\nGood location and environment.

I will stay there again.\nmake sure to read check in details beforehand or youll have to go back uphill and around like i did lol! great place\nOverall the Airbnb was nice and clean. However, the location is a bit of a nightmare to get to anything from. It will take you about an hour to get to any beaches, 30\/45 minutes to the city. That\u2019s on personal preference but so keep that in mind. <br\/>The room is small, it feels like a hotel room with a kitchen which made us feel really cramped. There\u2019s not a lot of kitchen space to cook either which is really inconvenient. The photos can be slightly deceiving. <br\/>We had a nice stay and all utilities worked well, the bed was comfy and the balcony is great to have on the hot days!\nOverall this place was located in a very convenient location, close to some really good eating places and walking areas.

Highly recommended!\nGreat location within walking distance from bars and restaurants.\nMe and my partner were in desperate need of a last minute air-bnb due to unexpected but necessary renovations of our place. <br\/>This place was very affordable and close to city.<br\/>Pros<br\/>- Extremely clean place. Smelled amazing upon arrival due to how fresh everything was.<br\/>- Walkable to Glebe Pt Road (restaurants, cafes, bars etc)<br\/>- 2 in 1 clothing washer dryer which was super handy.<br\/>- North-facing balcony gets plenty of sun.<br\/>- Friendly staff that kept accepting our extension requests for longer last minute stay.<br\/>Cons<br\/>(Nothing to do with property itself)<br\/>- Yappy poodle next door<br\/>- Neighbours in same apartment can be a bit noisy.<br\/>- There seemed to be a lot of construction noise while we were there. <br\/>- As stated in previous reviews, absolutely zero parking beyond 2 free hours in the entirety of the suburb. <br\/>Overall an amazing stay and would definitely stay again!

{"listing_id":38706799,"comments":"We enjoyed four days at Lisa and Ken\u2019s home, it is in a beautiful location with stunning views. Ask to use the inclinator as the pathway to the house and steps down to grass area are very steep so with luggage it would be easier. They did offer to show us but we managed ok in the end. Outdoor cushions do need replacing and bedding should be ironed, us Brits very fussy about bedding and towels! Other than that it was a very peaceful, beautiful location but you definitely need a car to get around.\nWe love staying at Lisa and Ken\u2019s place - it was a dreamy location and Lisa was such a great communicator despite being unwell during our stay! We would definitely stay again!\nI had the pleasure of staying in an outstanding Airbnb home to celebrate my  60th birthday with 6 friends, and I must say that it exceeded all expectations. The homeowners, Ken and Lisa, provided exceptional service and communication from start to finish, making the entire experience seamless and stress-free. The location of the home on the water was breathtaking, and the view alone was worth the trip. The house itself was absolutely beautiful and fully equipped with everything we could have possibly needed. It was clear that Ken and Lisa take great pride in their home, and it showed in every detail. Overall, our stay was unforgettable, and I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for an unforgettable vacation experience.\nWould stay here again!!!!\nA fantastic house in a lovely location.\nIt was a beautiful house in a peaceful location.. a great spot to unwind with the family.\nGreat location and quiet, house is amazing and well equipped with everything you need for a relaxing break. The outdoor spa was a winner and the AV was great!<br\/>Lisa and Ken were very accommodating and we would go back there if the opportunity arises in the future\nWe had a fantastic stay at Church Point.  An incredibly beautiful part of Sydney that not many know about. The little wharf was fantastic to fish off for our son, and the sea kayaks were great to explore the waterways. The house itself was beautiful inside, and the balcony was great for coffee and birdwatching in the morning and bbq-ing in the evening. All around an incredibly relaxing, indulgent and rejuvenating stay and Lisa was great in making sure everything went very smoothly for us. Highly recommend.\nBeautiful place, gorgeous balcony views and very nice and responsive owners!\nWe had a lovely stay, the water views and surrounding area are very beautiful. It is a great place for a peaceful getaway from the city. We also found the house to be very clean and well maintained.<br\/>A few things that I wish we knew about before booking:<br\/>- The owners stayed in a cottage directly attached to the house and so we didn't quite have the entire home to ourselves as advertised.<br\/>- The neighbours are also very close and lack of\/low fences meant they could see directly into the downstairs lounge while they were out in their garden. If we had used the hot tub, it would also have been in full view of the neighbour's house.<br\/>- The spa's heating function wasn't working during our stay. This wasn't the owners' fault but was a little disappointing as we had chosen the place mainly for the hot tub.<br\/>- The path from the house to the street-level driveway is at quite a steep incline and a fair distance but I do believe you can contact the owners to use the inclinator if you have a lot of luggage.<br\/>Overall these things didn't take away too much from our stay. We had a great time and would definitely recommend the place to others (with the above caveats).\nGreat place to have a weekend break for our family !\nCleanliness and privacy concerns raised with owner directly.\nWe absolutely loved it!\nGreat spot highly recommend it to others\nLisa\u2019s home was absolutely stunning, not to mention the view was breathtaking. While the weather wasn\u2019t on our side we still had the best weekend away, the fireplace was fabulous and it was the small details like blankets and board games that kept us going. Not the mention, the hospitality and communication from Lisa was above and beyond. We even left a bracelet and Lisa reach out straight away and even posted this. Would recommend to families and friends looking to get away! Thank you again x"}

Stunning, stylish home with impeccable interiors and exteriors. Generously stocked yet no clutter. Everything was intuitive. The host was an excellent  communicator.  A really special home.\nrebecca was a fantastic host.<br\/>house was amazing. even had a couple of friendly kookaburras that had a drink with us each afternoon.<br\/>would highly recommend staying here and we would definatly stay here again ourselves\nI chose to stay in this property the night before my wedding and to get ready on the day as it looked amazing. <br\/>However, there are so many rules dotted around the house, we all found it hard to relax. We found the rule about the noise for the neighbours a little unnecessary as when we returned home from the wedding, there was a huge party 2 doors down that went on until past 2am. There was no fresh milk in the fridge or good quality breakfast tea. The walls are super thin and you can hear other people walk around. The top bed shakes when people walk downstairs<br\/>For the amount we paid for this property, i would have expected for more little touches to make us feel at home but there were very few. Would not recommend this property if you want somewhere you can feel at home and relax in a quiet space. Have had much better experiences from other air bnbs. Very disappointed considering it was such a special occasion. Apart from the decor and the location, it is massively overpriced\nGreat place! Amazing kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms. Lovely views and amazing sunsets. A wonderful stay for us!\nGreat host, Rebecca with a nice location. Good for a family stay.\nA beautiful, private spot nestled amongst the trees overlooking the Pittwater and a short walk to Whale Beach. A very comfortable and stylish house. A great place to stay!\nThe house itself is nice in general but lacking closet space, there is no wardrobe in the master bedroom but a small chest of drawers. There are a lot of stairs to take to get into the house so if you have lots of luggage or less mobile it might be tricky. Be aware there are A LOT of house rules and there are penalties if you make any mistakes.The deck was dirty and needed cleaning after we checked in. There were some dirty socks left on the kitchen bench also. The swing broke while one of the guests sat on it (she didn\u2019t swing on it, just sat on it).Rebecca was condescending when we told her about how the swing broke. We misread the instructions and didn\u2019t leave the bins out when we checked out on Saturday thought the cleaners would leave them out since collection day is Monday and had to pay for $100 rubbish removal fee. We have traveled the world and stayed at many airbnbs and never had any issues but felt this house had a lot of circumstantial rules and made the stay less relaxing.\nThe house was lovely and clean & the beds were comfortable. The location is ideal for a quite relaxing retreat.  Rebecca was also very accomodating allowing a late check out.  <br\/>Our family of 6 stayed for Christmas and the kitchen had everything we needed plus more.  Great appliances, cookware, utensils & cutlery.  It made our stay very special.<br\/>The number of steps maybe challenging for the elderly or young children & Access to shops & beaches is best by car. <br\/>Overall a lovely, clean, private holiday retreat, with modern amenities that provided a wonderful experience. <br\/>Thank you\nWe had a fantastic weekend at Rebecca\u2019s place. The house is beautiful and was beyond expectations. Very clean with a great outlook. I would highly recommend staying here.\nWe loved our stay in this beautiful house. Our host was clear in setting her expectations. We understood from the start that this is a treasured property and has been furnished with care.  All of the information was correct & helped us to have a smooth check-in and departure.<br\/>Beds were comfy, the kitchen had quality appliances and the BBQ worked like a dream. Everything was perfect. There are many steps leading down feom the parking area to the front door so I suggest not bringing large suitcases. The steps lead you through a fairyland of vegetation which is delightful. However, all of this delight is eclipsed by the fabulous water views from the balcony. Also from the main bedroom and other bedrooms in the house.<br\/>We could not have asked for anything better. This place is a stunning, quality home & we loved it.\nTruly beautiful house, in a wonderfully spectacular location.  The view is to die for!  Great facilities, all beautifully furnished.  Would definitely stay again.  Thank you!\nVery well organised and beautiful place to stay with amazing views and gorgeous styling x\nreally lovely stay beautiful views and lovely house.

Highly recommend!\nI recently had the unfortunate experience of staying at this property that left me extremely dissatisfied and concerned for my safety. I feel obligated to share my experience in order to prevent others from encountering similar issues.<br\/>First and foremost, while the location appeared to be conveniently close to the CBD, the transportation situation was far from ideal. The closest station and shopping points required a significant amount of walking, which was quite inconvenient, especially if you have heavy luggage or are not fond of long walks.<br\/>However, the most alarming issue was the lack of maintenance and the resulting safety hazard. The lock on the bathroom door was damaged, and I found myself trapped inside the bathroom. Despite reaching out to the online customer service for assistance, they failed to respond to my messages. I resorted to calling their hotline, only to discover that they were located offshore. After a lengthy and frustrating conversation, they assured me that a\nNice and tidy comfortable place that is close to ammenities\nI enjoyed my stay.\nlove location. sweet teeny place. needs a ceiling fan! quiet and functional\nGreat and quiet location, would definitely stay again.\nNulla da dire in merito all\u2019alloggio stesso, servizi, mobilio e posizione. Tuttavia, abbiamo trovato la casa del tutto sporca, con capelli, peli, spazzola del wc, frigo e posate sporche, macchie sul muro e sulle lenzuola. Abbiamo provato a contattare l\u2019assistenza per ricevere un servizio di pulizia aggiuntivo o un rimborso almeno 8 volte e siamo sempre stati messi in attesa di chiamate o messaggi che poi non sono mai arrivate. Madecomfy non rispondeva nemmeno ai solleciti di Airbnb!! Per il prezzo pagato, l\u2019alloggio doveva essere consegnato perfettamente pulito, privo di ogni traccia di altri ospiti. Di conseguenza, servizio pulizia e servizio clienti assolutamente insufficienti. Oggi abbiamo lasciato l\u2019alloggio dopo due settimane dal nostro arrivo a Sydney e non abbiamo ancora ricevuto n\u00e9 un risarcimento n\u00e9 una risposta. Una tale disonest\u00e0 non ci era mai capitata in anni di viaggi per il mondo: nel momento del pagamento si \u00e8 disponibili ma al sorgere del primo problema ci si nasconde!\nBeautiful building in brilliant location.

The accommodation is an efficiency, just as advertised, and met all my needs. She sends detailed instructions for check in, which were clear.

Thank you, Andrea.\nThis is a modern studio in a really convenient location. I was travelling alone and felt very safe and secure and it was easy to walk to from Central Station. The property is exactly as the photos and Andrea is helpful and a pleasure to deal with.\nThis is not a private space, the studio is in someone\u2019s backyard so you have to have the curtains closed at all times. It also in no way sleeps 4 and you should take your own consumables as very little were supplied.\nGreat location, clean and tidy little space suitable for 2 people."}

He met me at the apartment and showed me how to use various items and had a very well put together list of restaurants and eateries around the area. This was indeed very good.

None will be provided even if you ask. Extra tower cost $70 each. Oh, don't seat on the chair as it is next to falling apart.<br\/>The customer service is no better than none.

Just be aware if you need anything, give plenty of time because the response wasn't the fastest and it's frustrating in certain situations. <br\/>Overall very satisfied!\nThis apartment was in a nice location. There's a bit of noise from doors opening and closing in the building, but it's not that busy so wasn't a huge problem. The place hadn't been perfectly cleaned but it was ok. Everything you need is in the apartment and the kitchen is particularly well equipped. Great location, right by a bus stop, lots of cafes and the Dulwich Hill shops in easy walking distance.\nFound cockroaches and spiders in the room. Very noisy, it\u2019s on a plane route and you can also hear the doors from the other apartments slamming. As it\u2019s in a suburb area, you can also hear a lot of wildlife at night. Host is very slow to respond. They also left me waiting the whole day at the apartment to fix an issue and never showed up! Bathroom window doesn\u2019t close properly. Location was good and 10 minute walk to the train.\nGreat pad\ngreat place but it would be a good idea to check the key box code you are sent. we were sent the wrong code."}

{"listing_id":41908525,"comments":"Stayed here for three weeks. Central location, easy to get everywhere by walking or good transport links. Lots of local food options available and quality good. Woolworths a 3 min walk. Apartment was kitted out with everything you need in the kitchen plus a w\/machine and dryer. Very powerful shower! Plenty of storage space for your clothes. Description and photo of the apartment is accurate. Anything else? Couple of points. Occasional low level noise from gym below but not enough to be obtrusive. Bathroom needs a shelf for toiletries and be prepared to enter and exit the bed from the end as it\u2019s a tight fit!<br\/>Did we enjoy our stay and would we stay there again? Yes!\nReally enjoyed our stay, thank you. <br\/>Property is exactly as described.\nIf you wanna book this place be aware that the check in is only 5pm, so you will be paying for half of a day.

The area is very quiet and clean with responsive management hosts. I would stay here again when I return to the city.\nLocation was amazing. Apartment was ok for the price, bathroom was a little bit run down (splitting paint on the wall). The kitchen knives were dull. Just a heads up there is a cycling studio on the ground floor, which you can hear (very loud bass) in the morning. Also didn\u2019t like that the owner pressured me to give a good rating. All in all a good stay.\nVery well located studio in Darlinghurst. Easy check-in experience and responsive host. Only thing to be aware of is that the studio is on top of a spinning studio which is quite loud in the early hours of the morning.

{"listing_id":41962524,"comments":"The apartment was exactly what we needed. Close easy transit to SASH at North Ryde and very welcoming of us and our dogs. Kerry was amazing at ensuring we were comfortable and had everything we needed and knew where to go for the best local food and dog walks. <br\/>The place is clean, comfortable and very private. The shower is phenomenal and the bed extremely comfortable. <br\/>We would recommend anyone with dogs to try this place. Especially if you are travelling for treatment at SASH like we were. <br\/>Thankyou Kerry for looking after us so well xx\nNice little apartment in the heart of haberfield. Super convenient location. Plenty of parking on the street. Very smooth check in & walk into a lovely  clean home with everything you need.<br\/>I stayed with an infant and there was a high chair (cot available too- I just didn\u2019t need it).  Heaters were on before we arrived (as it\u2019s now winter) which I think was very thoughtful. There is a chalkboard in the kitchen area with \u201cMia casa e tua casa\u201d written on it with cute little drawings on it ~my home is your home~ a nice touch.<br\/>All round so lovely!\nKerry was a great host. We enjoyed the area which was close to shops and restaurants. Thank you for making us feel at home.\nA great stay at Kerry\u2019s place, a lovely quiet neighbourhood close to everything you need. Loved that we could enjoy our stay with our fur boy!\nFriendly host and safe neighbourhood.\nSuch a convenient location and I could take my little toy poodle, my constant companion who loved the place. Kerry is a lovely and helpful host. Just loved my stay here.\nVery friendly host who cannot do enough for you\nWe enjoyed our 4 night stay at Kerry\u2019s and we were made to feel so welcome - a real home away from home. We especially loved being our to bring our puppy and the secure yard was wonderful for her. So close to walk to great restaurants and all that Haberfield has to offer.\nA home away from home. Clean, comfortable, a great location and Kerry is an exceptional host. We will definitely return!\nHighly recommended this home. The unit is very modern, well-equipped. comfortable and cleaned perfectly. The backyard is also great. The location is quiet and convenient and amazing for local cafes and restaurants. Kerry is great with communication.\nHad a nice 2 day stay at Kerry's place. Location was good. The accommodation was big and clean. There was just a wet or damp smell and I had to keep the windows and door open for a couple of hours, but no big deal really.\nGreat spot in Haberfield, close to cafes and restaurants. Unit was modern, spotlessly clean and well equipped for a short break. Easy checkin and Kerry was great with her communication. Highly recommended.\nWe stayed at Kerry's cosy little place for a week with our baby. It was a nice stay with a very modern bathroom, comfortable bed and good eateries within pram distance. Our baby loved the large windows looking out onto the street, and slept well in the porta-cot Kerry made available. The washer drier makes use of a heat pump so it worked well for our needs. A full sized dishwasher was also very useful. There's no fan\/exhaust over the portable stove\/grill and there's only a bar fridge, but there's so many well rated restaurants nearby it was an easy choice to eat out.<br\/>The space has a lot of appliances you can use, so we had some initial hiccups with the fuse, but Kerry was very helpful and the fuse box was easily accessible too. We did stay during the middle of winter and had both heaters going at times so it was just a case of figuring out how to better distribute the load across the many power points.\nI booked this for my elderly parents for a few nights while they were moving into retirement living. The heaters provided did not adequately heat the space. Additionally a fuse kept tripping and my parents were unable to reset it. We informed the host who told us not to move the heaters (the heaters were in the same place as when my parents checked in), but did not offer any other solution. Ultimately, my parents could only stay one night of a 4 night stay and I had to sort out alternative accommodation for them.<br\/>Additionally, the Netflix account had been logged in to the hosts account and was protected with a PIN. I messaged the host about this and the host emailed back a link to the Netflix website and said to follow the link to sort out logging in. I found the response from the host pretty disappointing and would have expected her to sort out the issue with the fuse and TV in person.\nWe highly recommend Kerry's lovely listing.  We were lucky enough to stay for a month in this beautifully designed space.  We especially recommend it for dog owners ... your dog will greatly appreciate their own enclosed backyard to explore, and long glorious walks around Haberfield where our dog Kit made many friends."}

Hopefully we\u2019ll be back soon!\nWe are regulars at Calyn\u2019s and enjoyed our stay as always. <br\/>Situated in the middle of Avalon village short walk to the beach.\nThank you for a fabulous and safe stay!\nAvalon is a great place to stay and the apartment is very convenient to everything. We found the apartment quiet, very homely and suitable for our needs. We have actually booked another stay!<br\/>The apartment, and in particular the bathroom and shower room, is a bit dated but lovely and clean. The bedding was crisp and fresh and there was a nice new carpet throughout the living room and bedroom.<br\/>Communication with the host was very easy and responses rapid.<br\/>We look forward to our next stay.\nThe apartment was perfect for us and so easy to stay in. It had secure free parking, high quality appliances, was comfortable and very modern and clean. They had really thought about what visitors might need for their stay. It was like being at home, it had everything. Location was perfect, we walked to everything in Avalon. Communication was excellent and they went out of their way to accommodate us. Highly recommended.\nWe were very happy with the place and it worked out well.\nWhat a lovely spacious apartment this was to relax in. Great eateries just downstairs, with the beach just minutes walk away. Great communication with the hosts throughout too. Would definitely stay here again for a beach get-away!\nInstructions to get into place and find bins were terrible. Linen was ripped, main bathroom ensuite roof leaked in rain, fan so loud you didn\u2019t want light on in bathroom and kitchen pans need to be thrown out. Hard to cook for small family and stains on couch but communication was good and location great. It was cheap but would fix these issues\nGreat stay in the centre of Avalon."}
{"listing_id":42547736,"comments":"Impossible to be better.<br\/>A wonderful place to stay very near the DeeWhy beach, which is very beautiful.<br\/>Good to go to Sydney and other cities for sightseeing.<br\/>In addition, the house was also clean and comfortable to stay and enjoy the beach.\nThe location of the apartment was a stand out factor being close to the beach, scenic walks and cafes \/ restaurants.<br\/>The kitchen facilities \/ utensils \/ stocking was probably the best I have seen in a rental, with lots of basics on hand without having to buy, e.g., cloths, dishwashing liquid \/ tablets, cling wrap, oil, s&p, etc. It always annoys me when I have to buy these items but there are always way more than needed and they then get binned by the cleaners - having these items available was a big plus.<br\/>My only negative was how dirty the window areas were and how hot the bedrooms got, even with the fans. We did stay at a particularly warm time (and humid) but I thought there was air con in the bedrooms but it was just the living area. The dirty around the windows was excessive and lack of fly screens was a bit annoying.<br\/>Otherwise a great stay and the owners were really helpful.<br\/>Thanks.\nLovely top floor flat with views of the beach. Great restaurants and shops of the beach front within a minute of the flat. Really good for us as close to family nearby and an easy bus ride to Manley to catch the ferry to central Sydney.\nThoroughly enjoyed our stay !!\nPerfectly located a very short walk to Dee Why beach and restaurants. Very homely apartment that had everything we needed for a week long stay. We are a family of 4 and had plenty of space. Kitchen lounge is a great size and the balcony was a good space to take in the sun and sights. More than enough essentials like towels, kitchen appliances and utensils etc. Major shops a 10 minute walk or easy drive with many options. Would book again.\nA well appointed and well positioned property with lovely and accomodating hosts. Myself and the teenagers had everything we needed for our birthday getaway. I loved being able to hear the sea at nighttime!\nWe had a wonderful stay. The apartment is spacious and light, with a great ocean facing balcony to relax in the sun on. It is on the 3rd (top) floor with no lift however easy to get to and very quiet \/ private. Free Parking out the back was a big bonus. The hosts are responsive and friendly; we had a slight maintenance issue while there and they sorted it out swiftly and professionally. <br\/>I definitely recommended to others looking to stay on the northern beaches.\nGreat place in a great location. The  apartment has everything you need, comfy beds, close to the beach and cafes. would definitely stay again.\nIt was a great and cozy place with many restaurants nearby and the host was very responsive and flexible. Highly recommended!\nGreat place to stay. Friendly and responsive hosts. Close to the beach and restaurants.\nA great little apartment in a great location, easy walk to the beach or the shops. <br\/> Very comfortable and had everything we needed.\nWe love that everything in the apartment is beautiful, clean, tidy, and comfortable.\nClear communication. Apartment was comfortable and as advertised. We enjoyed our stay.<br\/>Limited shared parking on premises was not always available when parking in the evening, and on street parking was equally hard to find. Also, note that there is no elevator in the building (so you'll have to walk up a few flights of stairs with your bags)\nGreat location - easy walk to Dee Why beach and cafes. We had a rental car with us and had no problems finding parking (in the shared spots in the building). Cosy and clean apartment.\nOur stay at Jono & Sarah's Apartment was beautiful... Walking distance to cafe's & beach. <br\/>Close to supermarkets. <br\/>Jono & Sarah's place is exactly as described & has everything needed for a comfortable stay .. <br\/>Thankyou so much .. :)"}

A cozy and modern appartment, with everything we needes for a few days stay in the city. The place was clean and fresh. In a good location with many good restaurants, and also within walking distance to Sydney center and public transportation.\nOverall great stay! The house was beautiful the self check in was easy to understand. Would definitely recommend!\nWe had a great stay at Peter's appartment. Very unique place and location. Super clean and beautiful. We loved all the art work and little details. The area is as unique and diverse as Peter's appartment. Everything is in walking distance. We went to some great restaurants in Chinatown and cafes around the corner.  Peter was always a step ahead and contacted us with all the information before we even had to ask for it. To get into the apparment sounded complicated but turned out to be easy. Thank you Peter for a wonderful short Sydney stay. We highly recommend Peters appartment and wished we had more time to actually hang out there.\nGreat place to stay and walk around Sydney. It is located in a Main Street, however once you enter the apartment you really can\u2019t hear any noise. We would recommend this place to other travellers.\nGreat location that is quite convenient and close to the main city area, only about 10 minute walk! Quiet and comfortable. <br\/>The place was beautifully decorated. I love their style and vibe. Very homely but also well furnished compared to more common Airbnb.<br\/>Perfectly cooled with great air-conditioning. And the beds and bedrooms were very comfortable. <br\/>Only things that would take points away were the stains on the quilt for the sofa bed and some the utensils seemingly a bit dirty or had food stains on them. <br\/>The hosts were very polite and kind and prompt.  Overall I was very impressed with the location and place. Their style is impeccable and comfortably furnished. The ideal place and location to wind down after a long day out in the hustle and bustle of Sydney central. <br\/>Thank you for hosting us!\nFantastic oasis in the heart of Oxford St, very quiet and clean & well designed. Had a great stay and will definitely book again. Rare find\nFantastic location - walkable to everything you\u2019d want to see in the CBD, or several public transport modes nearby for exploring further out. Layout and styling of the property was chic, inviting and well maintained. Feels very secluded despite being right on Oxford St. Getting the remote to access the carpark and returning at the end of stay can be a bit of a logistics challenge given very limited street parking nearby so recommend giving yourself a bit more lead time checking out to reduce stress. Otherwise this was a perfect stay and I would go here again next time I am in the area.\nPeters place was exactly what we were looking for. It was in the perfect location within walking distance of everything we needed it to be and the styling of the apartment was amazing and looked exactly like the photos. I was a bit worried about noise with it being on such a busy street but it was actually very sound proof inside which was great. Definitely hope to stay here again in the future.\nGreat!\nPeter\u2019s home was so lovely and in the perfect location - we were able to walk to Chinatown and also Sydney Harbour. Peter gave extremely clear instructions on check in and check out, which were very helpful.\nWhat a find in a brilliant location! I was grateful for the parking spot around the corner. The apartment is completely private, and the noise of the main street is not noticed as it faces away from the road. It is also bright and sunny for much of the day, and the roof garden is very cute. Sydney was really hot, so we were also grateful for the fans and air conditioning.  The interiors are also fun and cheerful.\nSurprising flat, feels like your own little piece of paradise in the middle of the big smoke. Check in and communication was all great and the place was spotless, highly recommend!"}

There's 3 large bedrooms with lots of storage, the bathroom includes a separate shower and bath, the kitchen is really big with a large island, which was so useful for food prep, the living area is big with a huge TV, there's a large dining table with 6 chairs, it has 2 outside seating areas, one front and one to the back, both undercover, it is 10\/15 minutes from both shopping centre and train station, I Would Definitely Recommend staying at Douglas and June's apartment, we will be back next year when we return to Australia!!!\nGreat place to stay\nDoug is a very friendly and good host.<br\/>His unit was very clean and much more spacious than the pictures showed. You can walk to Blacktown Station within 15-20mins which has frequent trains to central Sydney. It is also easy to use public transportation. There is a big shopping mall called westpoint near Blacktown station so you can get everything you need on foot.\nGeil\nLovely accomodation, aswell as being close  to the train station which is amazing!

Also the light rail is very close as well to get to other places in Sydney. The hotel staff is very friendly and professional. The room and bathroom was clean and clutter free.

The room was very clean, the staff was very friendly and responsive, and the location was perfect to get to where we needed to go. The only thing that impacted the experience was the light in the bathroom stopped working in the middle of the night, but we just dealt with it since we were leaving the next morning and it wasn't too big of an inconvenience. We let the front desk know so that it can be fixed for the next person. Overall, would stay here again!\nExcellent stay, great location.\nThe staff were so friendly and welcoming.

{"listing_id":44257409,"comments":"Great Location, lovely appartment\nThe penthouse at the Marina Brooklyn was comfortable , well appointed and spacious. It featured a large dining\/lounge area and extensive deck overlooking the water. It was an ideal location for us to host a small get-together of close family for a pre Xmas lunch.\nPerfect location above the water in Brooklyn a stone\u2019s throw from the ferry, water taxi and train station. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need, we lit the fire on the last night (July) while we played giant jenga, and it works beautifully, and was easy to clean in the morning. The cafe below served very good coffee, the staff both at the cafe and in the convenience store are all brilliant and friendly. The nearby pub has a wonderful covered outdoor area and also serves incredible pizzas. The local walk to the lookout and Parsley Bay was perfect after breakfast, and Dangar Island has captured my heart big time. Future guests: I\u2019d advise you to bring earplugs if you\u2019re a light sleeper to assist with the trains at night. Also pack your own loo roll if staying a while as it\u2019s wafer thin one ply. Some areas of the apartment are getting tired: broken kitchen drawers, wobbly dining chairs, but the view makes up for all that, a delightful stay was had and I\u2019d still come back.\n.\nGreat spacious apartment above the marina.  Plenty of space, huge balcony, fabulous bathrooms and comfy bed.  Easy walk to the pub for a great meal.  Kids loved fishing of the rocks around the corner as well as hiring a boat for one of the days.  Easy parking and also very close to the train station.\nGreat spot for a quiet weekend away. Beautiful large space, with everything we could have needed.\nBeautiful location close to everything! The apartment was also really spacious and comfy\nGreat spacious apartment close to all amenities for Brooklyn. Very clean, lots of room and space for a large family. The balcony was awesome!\nA beautiful place to stay thank you Richard and we intend returning. The apartment was overall clean and beautiful. It's a shame that the outside of the building is in need of a spring clean and some maintenance. This, however is easily overlooked as the apartment is so spacious and beautiful in a fantastic location. We will hopefully be staying again on a regular basis, twice a year. Very worthwhile :) We were very happy :)\nWe loved our time at the Brooklyn marina. Such a great spot to be located and have the ability to travel around the Hawkesbury region and see all the sights. The apartment was lovely and had all the things a family of 5 needed. Our favourite location was the huge balcony and watching all the boats come in and out of the marina. We were all sad to leave Brooklyn and definitely hope we\u2019ll be back again one day.\nRichard was excellent. He couldn't do enough to make us very welcome. Loved it soo big and spacious. Beautiful  views and very relaxing watching the boats coming in and out. Would highly recommend this place.<br\/>Thank you Richard\nLoved the expansive deck over looking the water\nBeautiful little gem, we stayed in the penthouse, very spacious and every bedroom has its own bathroom which was awesome. Elegant place, really enjoyed staying there, would definitely come back when we can. Kids loved the mini beach there. Thanks Richard and team.\nWe celebrated Mothers Day weekend in beautiful Brooklyn. The accommodation is a very short stroll from the train station (how we arrived) , close to River Cruise which we went on (riverboat postman) , foreshore walks and restaurants. We had so much space and utilised the amazing deck and bbq on both nights. Would highly recommend staying at The Marina Penthouse.\nWe really enjoyed the penthouse, the local pub was great and the Brooklyn corner cafe is the best I\u2019ve ever been to."}

The apartment is in a convenient location near buses to the city and a short walk to the bay. Its deck areas caught lots of sun, perfect for having breakfast outside.\nI spent three months at Belle's and had a great time there. Belle and her little dog Kit are fabulous hosts and it felt like home from the first day. <br\/>It was so easy to live with Belle and Kit put a smile on my face every day. <br\/>The apartment as well as my room and my own bathroom were perfectly clean and very well equipped. <br\/>The neighbourhood is great located, not far from the city center (5-10 minutes with the bus to central) but still very quiet and clean.

{"listing_id":45241596,"comments":"This apartment is in a fantastic location with the most stunning views.\nGabriel was always helpful and keen to help out. Always wanting to ensure the stay was as comfortable as possible without ever being overbearing. Location is fantastic and 100% worth visiting. The only drawback I\u2019d say is that if the weather is windy it can become slightly noisy but that\u2019s a very minor inconvenience on what was an awesome trip. A beautiful location without the crazy traffic of the inner city yet close enough that anywhere in the city you want to go is rarely more than a 15 minute drive. Less than a minute walk to the ferry and one of the best views you can find. Highly recommend Gabriel and this location.\nIts all about the view! Amazing location, every room with Bridge and Opera House views... The pool was amazing - same views. The building is aging, and the apartment would benefit from a few tweaks (i.e. door knobs falling off, missing light bulbs... and the addition of an air conditioner would go a very long way - we also had a false fire alarm go off in the middle of the night prompting a building evacuation - firefighters on the scene prob due to wiring \/ ongoing lift maintenance being the cause)... however in the grand scheme of things these are niggles and it was an amazing place to stay. One that will be memorable for the family for all the right reasons.\nLocation was great. Would definitely visit again. <br\/>Communication with the host was easy. <br\/>Would definitely come back\nGreat place to stay. Strongly recommend.\nWe love staying at Harbourside with it\u2019s spectacular views. A very short stroll to the ferry so easy to park the car and just take the ferry and trams all over the city.\nWe stayed at this lovely apartment twice over the last couple of weeks. it was perfect for our stay and was clean ,tidy and was perfectly located for our stay. The host left complimentary wine and personalised wine glasses which was a nice touch . The view in this apartment has to be the best view in Sydney with stunning views of Sydney Bridge,Opera house,Cbd and Luna park. Transport was very easy with the Mcmahons point Ferry just a   few feet  away and available every 16 minutes till 23:45 every night. Gabriel the host is easy to contact and went out of his way to ensure we were looked after. My son left his headphones but Gabriel got them to us before we left. We  loved our visit to Sydney and it was  made memorable because of the location of this lovely apartment.\nWe stayed ay this lovely property for a week. The property was perfect for us and had everything we needed. Gabriel was always at hand if we needed anything. As for the view  the most spectacular  view of the Sydney Bridge and Opera house from both the living room and bedroom.  The location is perfect with the Mcmahons point ferry yards away and every 16 minutes till 11pm at night. Thanks to Gabriel and this lovely property we enjoyed a very special week in Sydney.\nVery disappointing! we have been staying in this building frequently for maybe 30 years so knew what to expect and really like the location. There were 9 lights not working or globes missing, No aircon (expected} but fan in 1 bedroom not working. Same bedroom the blockout  blind was broken and not working. Window faces east so you get the full early morning sun from 5 am. Aussie sun is very bright, The filter blind OK for modesty but does nothing to stop sun or twinkling lights at night, Harbour bridge view is great but lights twinkle and flash all night worst 3 nights sleep I have ever had. Issues reported 1st night but despite 2 reassurances no one turned up to fix anything. Toilet kept running after flush occasionally.<br\/>Also wardrobe sliding door in hall was off its track denying access to iron etc...<br\/>We had a really nice time except for maintenance issues in unit. Felt like long term neglect.\nThis apartment is incredibly well appointed, everything supplied in kitchen, comfortable for 3 adults. Easy access with bus & ferry at your doorstep. Easy walk to the village of McMahons point. View was absolutely stunning!!\nBeautiful place.  Great location the views amazing.  Comfotable and clean. Communication excellent.\nGreat little unit with spectacular views. It was very comfortable and great location  close to ferry and cafes\nGreat stay, good communication from host. Thanks for a lovely time in Sydney!\nAmazing location! Like a movie set from every window. Great cafe and restaurants close by.\nThe views are exactly as advertised, stunning. Prime location with a wharf right at the end of the street, 10 minutes on the ferry to circular quay. Gabriel was responsive and proactive with communication. There is secure parking available which was handy. Hope to stay here again!"}

Her place is absolutely stunning and in a fantastic location. She made me feel at home from the moment I arrived. The place is stunning and beautiful decorated. I hope to stay again in future and would recommend her place for anyone looking to book in future. Thanks for a wonderful stay!\nMy favourite place in Pyrmont\nImmaculate, like the photos. Flexible with late check-in. Good location in Pyrmont and close to the river, but a fair bit of traffic noise late into the night so pack earplugs or headphones if you\u2019re used to quieter surrounds or a light sleeper.\nGreat central location which worked well for the purpose of my visit, great facilities and felt at home.\nThis is a very convenient location to the city.  There is a Light Rail station at the door. Laura is a friendly host, offering cups of tea, coffee.  Comfortable and immaculately clean unit.\nI must say I was blown away by the guesture of my host Laura. <br\/>Every day felt home away from home <br\/>I always looked forward to going back after my days activity.<br\/>Laura is so warm ,very helpful with helping you were needed.<br\/>Prompt response when I got stuck in town.<br\/>She\u2019s sure a super host <br\/>Thank you so much Laura foe my stay I loved every day I spent there \ud83e\udd17\nGreat place to stay..

Also the air vents for the air conditioning were very dirty with large amounts of dust and fluff stuck to the vent grills.  <br\/>The bathroom was functional with a good hot water supply.  However the shower head had to be jammed against the ceiling to keep it up right.  The Wi-Fi initially was pretty awful, but in fairness Gavin did upgrade with a much better output that resolved that issue.  Essentially this place is dark and although the room was functional, I wouldn\u2019t plan to stay again unless you are really on a minimal budget.   The rooms are tired and in need of brightening up.  Also my room at the end was right near to air conditioning vents and very noisy from the bar below on occasions.\n\uce5c\uc808\ud55c \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8, \ubc14\uc05c \uc640\uc911\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uccb4\ud06c\uc778\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \uc124\uba85\ud574\uc8fc\uc2dc\uace0 \uc815\ub9d0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. <br\/>\uc704\uce58\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc544\uc694 ^^<br\/>\ub2e4\ub9cc \uccad\uc18c\uc5c5\uccb4\uac00 \uccad\uc18c\ub97c \uc880 \ub354 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc4f4\ub2e4\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\uc5b4\uc694 <br\/>\ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uc790\ub9c8\uc790 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud658\ud48d\uad6c\uc758 \uba3c\uc9c0, \ucc3d\ud2c0\uc5d0 \uba3c\uc9c0\uc640 \uac70\ubbf8\uc904\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uba74 \uac1c\ube48\uc758 \uc219\uc18c\ub294 \ub354 \uc644\ubcbd\ud560\uac70\uc5d0\uc694<br\/>\ub9cc\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4"}
{"listing_id":45775427,"comments":"Hi ,Jorgia thanks for letting us stay in your beautiful cottage .The attention to detail was amazing I recommend it to my friends and family.Everything was  very clean and comfortable thank you\nWe liked very much this lovely, clean and comfortable cottage. We loved its great location very close to beaches, restaurants and shops. We would love to stay again on another trip in the future.\nPlace was as advertised and perfect. Easy to check-in and was spotless. Would highly recommend.\nMy husband, myself and our 3 year old had the most incredible 3 nights, we seriously felt sad to have to leave & could\u2019ve easily stayed 3 more nights! Jorgia was incredibly accomodating to our needs, responsive and helpful. The place itself is pristine. Sitting right above the most beautiful secluded beaches and a stone throw from everything else you need for supplies, restaurants etc. Already thinking of when we can stay here again! Highly recommend.\nWe found the accommodation attractive, stylish and comfortable. It was a relatively small space, but well designed to accommodate 4 adults and an infant in comfort.  While one of the reviews mentioned that there was no dining table, we quite liked eating at the counter on the bar stools. We also utilised the under-cover outdoor table.  <br\/>The location was quiet and picturesque and a short walk to beaches, the National Park and the excellent Bundeena CSC, which has excellent food and service - well above RSL standard - with many vegetarian options.\nBest\nJorgia\u2019s place was perfect for a weekend in bundeena! Very easy to chat with and organise details, and extremely clean and quaint home! \ud83c\udfe0\nLovely stay, clean quiet easy\u2026.\nIf I could give six stars I would. We loved the location and the cottage was very stylish. We really appreciated the thoughtful inclusion of breakfast and pantry provisions. Cheese, fresh fruit and wine awaiting us in the fridge, and lovely fresh eggs and milk. Great coffee too. The cottage had everything a fully functioning home has including iron and washing machine and dryer.\nGreat place to stay, quiet location with off street parking\nSuch a lovely little cottage with easy access to the beach, national park and club. Would highly recommend and will stay again!!\nThese beds were SOOOO comfortable. Loved the theme of the home and super amazing hosts! Thank you!\nCockatoo Cottage was the perfect place  for a weekend getaway. The cottage was beautiful, location was great easy walk to cafes , beach and The  National Park. Jorgia was great to deal with, very responsive. Definitely recommend!\nWe had a lovely girls weekend at Cockatoo Cottage. The place was clean and bright with modern furnishings. Location was a short walk to the beach and coastal walking tracks.  It was also so nice to have special treats left for us, a bottle of wine, cheese and some fruit and fresh milk. The host also offered us a late check out which we appreciated. Only negative was the size of the place. It was quite small and there was no dining table in the home, just bar stools.  Other than this, it was a great stay.\nWe had a much needed, short break away from the city with our 1 year old and the accommodation was perfect. Beautiful location and a very well equipped property, high quality finishes modern appliances with everything you could need. Jorgia was very attentive, very easy to get hold of and extremely accommodating. We will return and highly recommend the accommodation."}

We have had visitors from overseas and despite the weather not being the best, they were impressed with the beautiful location and accommodation. Thank you Jane!\nThe house is in a perfect location if you\u2019re wanting a peaceful and quiet stay, with a beautiful view of the water where we enjoyed our Christmas dinner. Short walk to a small dog friendly beach and a short drive away from palm and Avalon beach. Highly recommend this house and we hope to be back one day.\nJane's house is a paradise. As soon as I stepped inside, I was mesmerized by the view\u2014it\u2019s amazing. The house has everything you need and more. It\u2019s clean, beautiful, and very comfortable. You can sit back, relax, and watch the stunning sunset. The back door leads to stairs that take you down to a beautiful private beach. My kids enjoyed being there and have a great time every day. Jane is very easy to talk to and very helpful. I highly recommend her place.\nA lovely home in a peaceful location, yet only minutes to Avalon and Palm Beach.  The views of Pittwater are beautiful and relaxing and the home has everything you need while you\u2019re away.  Jane is a great host and communicated well leading up to and during the stay.  This was my second stay and I enjoyed it just as much as last time. Thank you, Jane and Brian.\nJane and Brian's home was just gorgeous. The house was even better than the photos and very well appointed. It was in a great location with a peaceful outlook and magnificent views. It also had everything you need when you are away from home. The bed was very comfortable and I loved listening to waves lapping up on the beach at night. The views were stunning and it was so relaxing watching the yachts sail by. Parking was easy and it was a short walk to the local shops and Paradise Beach. Jane was great with communication from the first enquiry and there was a comprehensive folder of information at the house. I enjoyed my time here and will definitely stay again. Thank you Jane and Brian.\nThe house is beyond amazing with great views that makes it very relaxing. Convenient location close to beaches and shops. Having bathrooms in each room makes it very comfortable for all guests.<br\/>The host provided very detailed instructions, couldn't ask for a better host. Every morning, there were birds joining us for breakfast, a pair of big white Cockatoo, King parrots, rainbow lorikeets , Kookburra, there is also a bush Turkey hanging around downstairs sometimes. <br\/>Our hosts had left us a nice note and a bottle of wine for when we arrived. They went above and beyond, we can't wait to be back and will recommend to all of our friends.\nWow, what a great place to get away in a hectic city.  We had a wonderful time. Home was great. Views amazing.\nSuch a lovely, well-appointed and comfortable home in a beautiful setting. Our inter-generational family of my elderly mother, adult children and toddler grandson loved our stay. There were stairs to the house (the top few don\u2019t have a railing (as Jane had pre-warned) and inside connecting two levels but Jane had thoughtfully installed a toddler gate for us. The kitchen was great, beds comfortable and views just lovely. The bird life was very special. A great long weekend stay. Thanks Jane!\nWe booked Jane's place for my wedding weekend and it was perfect.\nWow - what a beautiful house with stunning views. Peaceful and quiet but also close to Avalon shops and the beach. We had such a wonderful stay and hope to be back again soon.<br\/>Jane was very responsive and communicative. Thanks for a wonderful stay.\nThis was a wonderful home to stay in as a large family group. It was one of those AirBNB houses that are even better in person than in the beautiful photos. We stayed here with two couples, my Mum, my sister, my teenage nephew and two of our doggies and we all said we would go back in a heart beat. The layout is great and everyone has their own piece of space if needed. The balcony\/deck was wonderful and we were out here even when it was a little cold just because it was so pleasant. The kitchen was well equipped. Jane was extremely helpful and responsive to all of my questions and I could not say better things about a host. All in all a wonderful stay and we will be back!\nThe house was absolutely stunning. The view is better than the photos. Great kitchen for cooking and deck for dining.\nThis was the perfect stay.  The house is magnificent, the location beautiful and all this coupled with the best host in terms of communication and helpfulness makes this an incredibly memorable weekend with all the family.\nWe have just enjoyed a fantastic long weekend enjoying this property with our extended family. The house suited our needs beautifully - with separate bathrooms for each room, spacious bedrooms and then a functional, bright and inviting kitchen\/living area where we could come together to enjoy meals and chat. THe views out over Pittwater are spectacular and we had visits from some of the native birds one morning on the balcony which was fun for our kids. <br\/>The only (minor) issues that we experienced were firstly the amount of sunlight in each of the rooms in the morning. There are no blinds\/curtains on the upstairs rooms whilst the screens on the downstairs rooms offer limited shading so it was an earlier start to the day than some of us were expecting. Secondly, the first set of stairs leading down from the carport to the house have no rail (the second and longer ones do) so this was a bit of an issue for two of our older family members who needed some support.\nWe really enjoyed our stay. The location and view was truly stunning.  We felt very at home and enjoyed the well equipped kitchen.  We would definitely recommend to friends and loved the peacefully tranquility.  Thank you for sharing your place with us."}

Place is super close with plenty of food\/shopping options nearby and the Chatswood train station.\nWe had an amazing stay at this apartment in the heart of Chatswood. The location is unbeatable \u2013 just steps away from Westfield Shopping Centre and the vibrant Chatswood markets, which run on Thursdays and Fridays. The convenience of being able to walk to everything was fantastic!<br\/>The apartment itself is clean, spacious, and comfortably accommodated our group of four mums. With two bedrooms and two bathrooms, we never felt crowded. The host was incredibly accommodating with our requests, making our stay even more enjoyable.<br\/>The apartment is well-equipped with everything you need, including coffee pods, cutlery, and a kettle, so it's perfect for anyone planning a longer stay. The only minor point is that the shower pressure was a bit on the lighter side, but it didn\u2019t detract from our overall experience.<br\/>If you're planning a stay in Chatswood, don't hesitate \u2013 this place is a gem! Highly recommend.\nJessie was very friendly and she replied messages promptly. Her place was clean, cozy and good location. Very convenient, few minutes walk to shops, restaurants and train station.\njessie\u2019s place located in the heart of chatswood. walk to everything .very clean and tidy. spacious too! <br\/>will certainly recommend to all my friends !\nIt was nice place and Jessie is.great host"}

Everything else was perfect. The host also offered to store my bags. Thank you Peter and s!\nPeter & Stephanies Darlinghurst apartment was a lovely landing spot for my first trip into Sydney. I stayed there for 3 weeks and the accommodations were perfect for acclimating to the city life. The apartment was exactly as described in the listing and Stephanie was always friendly and responsive when I had questions about local recommendations. There were no maintenance or issues with the apartment while I stayed there. On hot summer days the A\/C was a blessing to help cool me off after a day walking all over Sydney. And the private balcony was just lovely to sit on in the mornings to enjoy the sunrise or the evenings to watch the bats fly over to Hyde Park for the night. The kitchen and bathroom were adequately equip and the washer\/dryer in the unit was so convenient. The apartment is steps away from lots of exciting city activities and food\/coffee options. I felt safe as a solo female traveler staying in their flat and would rent it out again if Im back in the area.\nI loved my time here and would recommend to all 10\/10\nThe apartment was in a very convenient location to Sydney CBD and The Domain. While the apartment is small, it was also perfect for our needs and I loved the little balcony with the view over the tops of the close terrace houses.<br\/>Due to the weather, check-in was a bit wet as we needed to watch a very quick YouTube tutorial on how to open the lock to get our keys and walk up some stairs. non of which were undercover. If it's rainy weather, please bring an umbrella or be clear of the instructions beforehand.<br\/>As mentioned, there were stairs. Not many, but they were narrow. We were aware of this and as we were only staying 1n, we packed very light.<br\/>Inside the place felt fresh and clean.<br\/>small kitchen with all the appliances you could need.<br\/>Living space had a comfortable bed, small chair, desk, TV, ample wardrobe space, two full length mirrors and air conditioning.<br\/>Bathroom had a decent sized shower, water pressure was great, plus had a washer and dryer.<br\/>I would recommend and stay again.\nOnly 4 stars because it is not possible to avoid the early morning sunlight from shining right into the bed and there were at times noisy renovations upstairs. Otherwise the flat is perfectly located and has everything one may need for a long stay in Sydney. May not be suitable for a couple as it is small flat.\nA very small but thoughtfully equipped, clean studio apartment in a central location.\nGreat little studio in an excellent location.<br\/>Short walking  distance to Hyde Park and lots of restaurants\nThis apartment was perfect for our first time in Sydney. It was well located with plenty of public transportation to get around the city. The apartment was perfectly sized for our week-long stay and got so much natural light throughout the day. Peter & Stephanie provide a helpful guide to the apartment and the surrounding area which was very helpful. And the laundry machines were the cherry on top! I would love to stay here again in the future!\nEnjoyed our stay, good location and nice little place. Would stay again.\nIt was an initially confusing layout of the central building, but easily remedied. Great surrounding location for going out for dinner and the night life. The facilities were clean and matched the photos.\ntodo maravilloso \ud83d\udc4f\nGreat place, super clean and really good location. Really responsive hosts too! Would recommend \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\nit is a great place to stay, it was very clean , quiet and spacious enough for great ambience\nloved the location and the apartment is also amazing. highly recommend.\nAbsolutely and even more than that satisfied with my stay!

{"listing_id":46859860,"comments":"Tolle Lage in Sydney. Wohnung sehr klein aber bietet alles was man ben\u00f6tigt.\nDecent place to stay in a convenient location. Some minor issues in that the place does get quite hot in summer (with the portable fan\/aircon unit not effective in cooling the space), and the water pressure was inconsistent, but otherwise, was a pleasant stay. Would recommend to others staying in Sydney.\nBooked the place for my family who came to Australia from overseas. The visit went smoothly and the place was what we expected: clean, and included everything needed. Communication was easy and the host was friendly. Would book again!\nLe logement \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la description : tr\u00e8s propre et proche du centre-ville, avec des commerces \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Les \u00e9quipements \u00e9taient tels qu'indiqu\u00e9s. Si je devais sugg\u00e9rer l'ajout d'un seul \u00e9quipement, ce serait un four. Sinon, rien \u00e0 redire.<br\/>Tr\u00e8s bel accueil, et arriv\u00e9e tr\u00e8s facile.\nWe stayed here for a month and it was great for what we needed. The location is amazing, in a happening part of Rushcutters bay, 5 minutes walk from Coles and half an hour walk to the city, as well as just a 30 minute trip to Bondi Beach. <br\/>It had lots of great amenities, including a good air con unit, strong wifi, great kitchenware, and lots of toiletries and cleaning products. Greg and Fawad were also both very responsive and helpful with check in and check out and any other questions we had during the stay. <br\/>As per other reviews, the road noise is incredibly loud as the windows are very thin and don't close properly, which, alongside the slightly broken blinds, made it hard to have much of a lie in! It was also quite dusty when we arrived but we did arrive a few days after the cleaners had been. <br\/>Overall the place is small but bright and airy and good value for money. It had everything we needed for our stay in Sydney and I would recommend it if you are a good sleeper!\nAmazing location!! Very conveniently located to kings cross train station, making it very easy to get around. Shops close by, loads of food spots, cute safe neighbourhood, great view. It\u2019s a small studio and what you see is what you get. Greg and Fawad were super easy to reach out to and communicate with!\nI wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I encountered a few issues. The check-in\/out process was quite inconvenient, especially for solo travelers with bags. Picking up and returning the keys to a secondary location at King\u2019s Cross was challenging with two suitcases and additional carry-ons. I expected the key safe to be onsite as mentioned in the listing. Additionally, the listing didn\u2019t mention the 10 front steps, which made lugging bags up and down difficult to reach the lift.<br\/>The listing mentioned a clothes dryer, but there was only a clothes hanger, making it hard to wash and dry clothes before leaving. The water pressure was also sporadic. Despite these issues, the place was clean and economical, with convenient open-air parking for a large SUV. The bedsit was charming with great sunrises and access to local attractions. The welcome hamper was excellent, and although it\u2019s not the quietest place, it worked well for me. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the amenities w\nClean place, nice view. The windows don't block much of the noisy street below so bring ear plugs\nGood location and comfortable bed and having a carpark available was excellent. Quite small apartment but it is a studio after all. As it\u2019s an older building the sound insulation is minimal so it can be quite noisy. <br\/>A little different to what I was expecting but all in all an okay stay for the price.\nHad an amazing time thanks greg\nReally was the perfect stay for what I needed. Such a convenient location, and what an amazing view. The perfect studio apartment for anyone wanting to be close to everything Sydney has to offer.  Greg and Fawad were very responsive with whatever I needed or any questions I had. I\u2019ll be back and would recommend for sure.\nProperty location was perfect for the weekend activities planned\nI stayed at Greg's place for 2 weeks.  Greg was very communicative.  Location was great; close to stores and restaurants in Kings Cross, Potts Point and Rushcutter's Bay.  Beautiful views.  <br\/>I recommend Greg's home.\nNot properly cleaned, hair and other peoples used cosmetic prpoducts left. Cockroach infested kitchen. Rattling windows and screendoor.\nAmazing little studio in a fantastic location! Just down the block to the train station and several grocery stores. Beautiful view made it so easy to work from home there. Bathroom and kitchen areas were very clean, bed was really comfy. I know some reviews said it might be loud from street noise but I didn't notice that at all!"}

The position is wonderful- a few steps to Parsley Bay and a lovely walk to Nielsen Park and also Watsons Bay. <br\/>Already looking forward to staying again!\nShane's apartment is in an exceptional location. it is around 30 seconds walk from the front of the apartment to the swing bridge of the picturesque Parsley Bay beach. Only 15 minutes walk further on brings you to Watson's Bay where a number of cafes, restaurants and take aways are right on the waterside. Having a ferry terminal here also makes other locations such as Manly and Circular Quay easily accessible.<br\/>The apartment is exactly as rendered in the AirBnB photos. It felt elegant, spacious and light and airy. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were well appointed.<br\/>Shane was highly responsive to requests particularly around some potential accessibility issues, offering to assist us as the stairs could have been a challenge. He was also helpful with suggestions for transport options and places to go.<br\/>Overall, this is a well appointed, well located elegant apartment which has been a joy to stay in. Highly recommend.\nLovely space. Last minute booking with great communication. Location is unreal, we\u2019ll be back\nStunning & perfectly located property within a few steps of Parsley Bay bridge & beach.\nSuperb location and beautiful apartment. An idyllic place from which to explore Sydney for a few days.\nFantastic location, we felt right at home and enjoyed this apartment as our home base in the Eastern Suburbs\nBeautiful  and peaceful part of the world. 50m from the apartment is the picturesque Parsley Bay. It was an excellent location as a base to walk and explore the South Head, Hornsby Lighthouse, the Gap, the Bondi to Bront\u00eb cliff walk and to get the ferry from Watsons Bay to Circular Quay. The kitchen was well equipped and after either poached salmon or stir fry, we could sit back, relax, drink wine and stream a movie.\nLovely stay, clean and well presented unit\nThis place is really awesome. Set up for airbnb but still with some homely amenities like a full kitchen, washer dryer, etc. If I have to call out one point of criticism it is the stairs. There are multiple to climb and descent. However you get beautiful surroundings in return.\nComfortable stay , good location .\nGreat location. Apartment is spacious , clean and well presented. Will be back. Thanks Shane for being a great host\nHad an amazing stay. Loved the apartment, the location, comfy beds, lovely linen. We had everything we needed and more. It was such a relaxing break and will be returning.\nClean, modern, light and airy apartment. Located a short 10 minute walk away from Watsons Bay ferry terminal  which offer a cheap 15 minute ferry ride to Circular Quay.. The 325 Bus stop is metres away from the apartment and takes you to Edgecliff from where you can catch the metro into the city. Host was very quick to respond when we asked any questions. All in all, we had a lovely 5 days at Shane\u2019s apartment and would certainly recommend to anyone wanting to visit Sydney.\nBeautiful spot, parsley bay surprised me with how stunning it was. Very quiet. Highly recommend."}

Other than that all is good!<br\/>Thanks Prue.\nLovely,  clean studio apartment which was great value for money!\nA place like home, with rooms that are not too big or too small, just right, and a kitchen and utensils. My partner and I spent a wonderful week here. It's not possible here. It only takes 10 minutes to get to the Macquarie University subway station.<br\/>The landlord is very friendly. If it weren't for the fact that I already have a place to live in CBD, I might choose to stay here for a long time. Every time I pass by the university campus, it reminds me of the time I spent chasing my dreams when I was young.\nPrue habe ich leider nicht kennengelernt, aber sie war immer per Telefon zu erreichen. Das Zimmer war wunderbar mit eigenem Bad und K\u00fcchenzeile und ger\u00e4umigem K\u00fchlschrank. Waschmaschine und Trockner standen mir kostenlos zur Verf\u00fcgung. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist die Stra\u00dfe, die etwas laut ist, aber nachts ist wenig Verkehr. <br\/>Es ist von dort etwas weit um in die Innenstadt zu kommen, man braucht weit \u00fcber eine Stunde. <br\/>Es ist ganz in der N\u00e4he von der Macquarie Universit\u00e4t.\nCommunication with host good.

I have a clean room, a separate bathroom and air conditioning. I can wash and dry my clothes here. The most important thing is that I don\u2019t have to worry about parking, I can park my car here with peace of mind. This is a very good place, and the host is also very kind.

GOOD experience!!\nThe location of Julie\u2019s unit is walkable to darling harbour and the neighbourhood is quiet and close to everything.

Quelques petits soucis fonctionnels sont \u00e0 noter \u00e9galement (le branchement de la machine \u00e0 laver n\u2019est pas fiable, la porte d\u2019entr\u00e9e s\u2019ouvre seule si elle n\u2019est pas ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 cl\u00e9, la poign\u00e9e de porte entre la douche et les WC est \u00e0 revisser, le frigo est petit, le s\u00e8che-linge ne s\u00e8che pas le linge). Pour terminer, le processus d\u2019entr\u00e9e et de sortie de la maison est plus compliqu\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement (manipulation \u00e0 faire en ligne avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e et long message avec des consignes pr\u00e9cises la veille du d\u00e9part).\nRobyn was helpful and always on hand to answer queries no matter the time or day.

The accommodation is very well appointed, exceptionally clean  and is relaxing space to return to after a day of touring Sydney.\nMy husband & I have been staying at Mavericks Retreat for 10 years and the location is great for us regarding the location of our families who live in the area .

The communication with Robyn was tip top, stars host!  A quick respond and very helpful advise. We will definitely recommend to our friends. <br\/>Thousands thanks for a lovely stay!\nA wonderful stay in a beautiful home. Robyn was an amazing host and we would very much recommend.

The property is great for relaxing, doing fire pits, and enjoying the private open space away from the city. Great for kids, and they had a lot of fun feeding the farm animals. Marguerita and her family were lovely, and made our stay so much more special. Looking forward to staying again! Well recommended.\nEverything was good\nWonderful night stay in cute tiny retreat. Everything was fantastic and really appreciated kindness of the host.\nAmazing place to stay\nSecond time visit! Great little getaway, even with dogs !\nThank you for your beautiful hospitality and providing us extra blankets to survive the night! We had a wonderful time and definitely one to remember. The place was clean and accurate with all the amenities. <br\/>The BBQ area and fire pit is further down, luckily we brought our own charcoal BBQ set so we had our BBQ on the balcony. Setting up the sofa bed is easier than you think, just have to pull the backrest to about 45 degrees and there are zippers on the seat cushion where you can pull up the legs! <br\/>Had so much fun feeding the pony (sorry forgot the name) and having the farm animals around!

Marguerita and Abud are kind, lovely, and generous hosts who would go the extra mile to make our stay comfortable. From the marshmellows for the bonfire, extra blankets and pillows, to the pellets for chicken\/sheep feeding, you could tell that a lot of thought was put into making the tiny house as cozy as it is! <br\/>Communication was very easy, just need to get there before it gets dark (at least before check in) as the drive down terrain could be a bit tricky. <br\/>We had an enjoyable and memorable stay. It certainly did not feel like we were just an hour away from home.. Thank you very much for such a lovely stay!\nThis is an incredibly pet friendly and child friendly getaway, that doesn't require a big drive out of Sydney. The presence of the animals were charming, the showers are hot, and there were just enough reception on the phone to answer the odd messages here and there. There is a campfire and BBQ that is shared with another similar cabin on the property, which didn't cause any issues when wanting one's own privacy. Importantly, the hosts were incredibly friendly, responded to messages quickly, gave us fresh eggs from their farm, and had firewood ready. We had a lovely two nights here!\nSo happy we stayed at this wonderful part of the world. My boys and I loved it. They particularly  loved their new friends (the hosts children) and want to come back to play with them some more. Feeding the animals was fun and there\u2019s something a bit magical about a tiny house. The host was incredibly generous, hospitable and kind. We loved the loft bed.

I stayed with a (rather large) dog and found that the space was good enough for the 3 of us.

We\u2019ll definitely come back!\nMy husband and 4 year old had a wonderful time and our one night stay felt so much longer as Marguerita was incredibly flexible with our Sunday check out.   Marguerita and Aboud are such lovely people, welcoming us upon arrival and going above and beyond to help us with everything we needed, even giving us some delicious lamb skewers to enjoy on the BBQ!  We had the entire property to ourselves and found it incredibly relaxing and peaceful.  Marguerita suggested The Orchards, which is only a few minutes drive, where they have a lovely play area for kids, lovely food, farm animals to feed and a well sticked farm shop.  The owner was also telling us they do fruit picking and tractor rides in the summer so we're keen to go back.

Plenty parking on the street and self check in was easy, the overall experience was smooth and I'd definitely recommend Alan's place for other travelers.\n\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u623f\u5b50\u4ee5\u53ca\u623f\u4e1c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fbf\u5229\uff0c\u5c4b\u5185\u8bbe\u65bd\u9f50\u5168\uff0c\u4e0b\u6b21\u8fd8\u4f1a\u518d\u6b21\u9884\u5b9a\nThe house was wonderful , it's clean and matched the description, the property seems new and well built. Alan also was very nice and helpful.\nThe house itself was big and spacious and comfortable but unfortunately the road noise was an issue when trying to sleep. This house should really have double or triple glazed windows to make it more soundproof. The big shocker for us was the signs in all the toilets that we couldn't throw the toilet paper in the toilet and to dispose of it in the bin next to the toilet. One of the toilets had a mesh bin with no plastic bag or lid to the bin. This was extremely off putting and we felt like we were in some old village somewhere in Europe with outdated sewerage systems. As much as I liked the house and it fit our group I probably would struggle to stay there again.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nGreat place and very clean. Central to everything. Couldn't fault it.\nVery comfortable townhouse and close to transport and restaurants. The kitchen appeared to be well stocked although we eat out at the many restaurants close by.<br\/>As said by others, the property is on a main street.  With the double glazing the noise was not a problem for sleeping.  Perhaps bring ear plugs if you are a very light sleeper. There were six of us and we all slept well.<br\/>The entry instructions were clear and Alan was always responsive.  It is the perfect property for families or large groups with plenty of room.\nGreat host with easy check-in instructions and a beautiful, clean place! 10\/10 stay, would recommend.\nGreat Place"}
{"listing_id":49998333,"comments":"There are no blinds, only very light curtains so if you have trouble sleeping in the light, this is not for you. This also makes it very hot during the day, some blinds would make such a big difference to keep out the sunshine and heat during the day and then not have a hot apartment in the evening.\nQuiet and peaceful gem\nVery comfortable stay, lovely bright apartment with great amenities and views.\nAmazing!\nGreat place!\nPerfect!\nWe had a great stay here - it was a lovely clean apartment in a great location with an amazing view of the sunrise over Bronte beach.

N\u00e5r det gjelder basisartikler som salt, pepper, s\u00f8ppelposer og oppvasks\u00e5pe, er det rom for forbedring. Det var kun to sm\u00e5 engangspakker med oppvasks\u00e5pe, \u00e9n s\u00f8ppelpose (for seks dager) og ingen salt eller pepper tilgjengelig. Vi valgte derfor \u00e5 kj\u00f8pe salt- og pepperkverner, oppvasks\u00e5pe og en 30-pakning med s\u00f8ppelposer, som vi h\u00e5per de ikke har kastet slik at fremtidige gjester kan dra nytte av dem.\nLovley little flat with great views and a cosy little space to spend the week!\nStayed here for 1 month. Great location in Waverley with a nice walk to the beach. Very quiet and peaceful block that made us  feel right at home. Modern kitchen and bathroom made staying here good with all the equipment and furniture needed.\nDie Unterkunft bietet alles, was man f\u00fcr einen Aufenthalt zu zweit braucht, h\u00fcbsch ausgestattet und sauber. Ganz besonders ist aber vor allem die Aussicht, \u00fcber Bronte und Bondi bis auf das Meer. Der Sonnenaufgang kommt direkt in die Wohnung und zum Strand und den Caf\u00e9s der Gegend sind es schnelle 10-20 Minuten durch sch\u00f6ne Stra\u00dfen.\nSpotless apartment stylishly decorated. Great view over Bront\u00eb to the ocean. Would stay again without hesitation. Greatly enjoyed our stay.\nComfortable stay, nicely furnished and clean. Great view from the main window and from the balcony of the beach. The only downside was that there was only a thin blanket on the bed and so I had to request another blanket or duvet, for which there was an extra charge."}

Sowohl zu Fu\u00df als auch mit den \u00f6ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln kann man von hier aus ganz Sydney erkunden. Moira ist eine perfekte Gastgeberin und reagiert immer sofort :)\nIdeal location in the heart of North Sydney, with easy access to transport and local cafes. Moira is a very welcoming host, who ensured we had everything we needed and got settled in. The apartment is well appointed and very comfortable to stay in, while the rooftop pool is a lovely bonus. Highly recommended.\nHome Away from Home - I can\u2019t say enough about this amazing condo in North Sydney. Great space with all amenities-including a washer and dryer! Breathtaking pool and deck with amazing views. A grill (yea) and the perfect real neighborhood to feel like you lived in the city versus being a tourist. Near to great public transportation and inexpensive Ubers abound. Moira is a gracious and charming host who is extremely generous in sharing tips and information so you visit is fabulous.\nMoira's place was great, the pictures didn't do it justice, very homely and comfortable, she made us feel very welcome even leaving a bottle of fizz, wine and chocolates.<br\/>she gave us valuable information on how to get around and where to go.<br\/>we would definitely recommend Moiras apartment to anyone.<br\/>Thanks Moira\nFantastic stay, and so easy and flexible to deal with. Thanks again Moira\nI had an absolutely wonderful stay at Moira's place. She is a gracious host with a beautifully appointed apartment with lots of vibrant artwork. She was so helpful when gaining access. She even looked after my puppy the day I needed to go to work taking her for walks during the day. The location is ideal, just a short walk to the metro making getting around Sydney a breeze, and Moira had lots of great recommendations for places to go. The coffee shop downstairs was amazing too. I didn't want to leave.\nExcellent place!!\nClean, quiet and very comfortable apartment.  It quickly felt like home.  Moira was very easy to deal with in all aspects and was very helpful with any requests.  A great stay for anybody who wants a North Sydney experience.  Very close to public transport and amenities.\nA beautiful apartment and very convenient to shops and transport. Thanks Moria\none of the best places I've stayed in Sydney.  would 100% recommend.  thank u Moira\nMoira's apartment was the perfect base for our 2.5 weeks in Sydney to visit friends and family! <br\/>The space was the perfect size for the two of us (and all our luggage!!) and we felt right at home. The building is pretty quiet so despite being well located in North Sydney with trains and amenities close by, you dont feel too 'in the thick of it'. Having St Leonards Park up the road was perfecrt for morning or evening strolls too. <br\/>The balcony was perfect for warm evenings and the rooftop space with pool was perfect for getting over the jetlag, having travelled across from Scotland. Definitely gave us 'holiday' vibes! <br\/>The kitchen was well enough equipped for basic cooking several nights, but there are so many restaurants and eateries around that you'll likely want to eat out anyway! The bed was superb, an ultra comfortable king bed. Bliss! <br\/>Honestly, we wouldnt hesitate to stay again on our next visit to Sydney, and would recomend it to eveyone else, too!\nMoira's apartment was amazing. It had everything we needed and felt like an actual home with very comfortable bed and pillows. It had a nice rooftop pool and the location suited us. There are plenty of places to eat around and a shopping centre. It was very easy to get into CBD of Sydney by public transport.\nWe have stayed at MANY airbnb's and Moira's place deserves a 10! Although I love keyless entries, it is always so special to meet the host and Moira is delightful and helpful & resides just down the hall.  The place is even more beautiful than photos. Pure class. Excellent building, pool, gym, personal lanai areas. Kitchen great for preparing meals and include oils, spices, eggs, etc! Very comfortable bed and lovely sheets and pillows. Outstanding shower and products. Perfect location; easy walks to bus or train or restaurants. Coles grocery and a bottle shop a short walk. We loved doing the Saturday parkrun (we're walkers) just 10 minutes away. Only regret is only staying 6 nights. Moira has thought of everything.\nGreat stay at Moira\u2019s. Comfortable bed, nice deck and great views from rooftop terrace. Easy walk to the train station making getting around Sydney a breeze.\nThe apartment was in a great location- the surrounding area was extremely walkable, commuter friendly, and offered a multitude of activities to do. Apartment was just as described in the pictures and simple to navigate getting into. Host was responsive to our messages and went above and beyond to check us in and offer local recommendations. Thank you for making our stay in Sydney so comfortable Moira!"}

It offered such a nice spacious place indoor and outdoor with lots of amenities available. Definitely the cleanest place we've stayed at and would recommend it to anyone wanted to escape Sydney city life that's not too far and relax.\nWe loved staying at LuLu's beautiful property surrounded by the natural landscape. <br\/>The house is beautiful, very spacious, and clean. Lulu has provided so many things for guests to do inside and outside the home there's more than enough to occupy everyone. We hardly spent enough time to enjoy everything she had made available.<br\/>It is clear Lulu loves the home and wants her guests to feel the same.\nlulu and Greg were both very kind and super enthusiastic, they greeted us so lovingly they allowed the kiddies to visit their chick's just an overall pleasant experience 100% recommend will definitely keep this listing on our books. cheers lulu and family\nLulu's place was amazing!

The pool was clean, the BBQ stove was excellent, and the bonfire was truly out of this world. We appreciate your kindness in ensuring the air conditioning was on before our arrival. Although the mobile phone connection was weak, having access to WiFi made everything okay. Special thanks to Greg for answering the call on Saturday night! We thoroughly enjoyed the privacy of the location. Looking forward to staying at your property again in the near future!<br\/>Thank you again, Lulu & Greg!\nMy family and I enjoyed the Australia Day long weekend at Lulu\u2019s and couldn\u2019t have picked a better place to stay. Heaps of space both inside and out, all the room you need with 9, 7 and 5 year old boys. The pool was great and used several times a day, as was the motocross track, which was perfect for my 7yo and his PW50, plus his younger brother. The property is very private and peaceful, with the only sound coming from the birds and cicadas (and the kids of course). The only problem is we didn\u2019t stay longer! The house is well equipped with everything you need and instructions where necessary. Having no mobile phone reception was welcomed and the house has wifi if\/when needed. Greg and Lulu were extremely easy to communicate with, very prompt and helpful at all times. We\u2019ll definitely be back for another long weekend in the future.\nBeautiful home. Beautiful surroundings. Amazing hosts. Very peaceful. It felt like a home away from home. Highly recommend!\nHad an amazing get away, the house was perfect for a relaxing, peaceful holiday! Its luxury meets bush retreat! Lulu and Greg were absolutely fantastic, very friendly and always happy to answer any questions we had. The house was very spacious, clean and easily accessible!

{"listing_id":50316048,"comments":"Perfect place to stay for a few short Sydney trip. As many others said, the beds are pretty hard and it could be slightly cleaner overall.<br\/>However, the location is super with a bus stop right in front of the building that brings you to all hotspots in minutes.<br\/>We also liked the two bathrooms (pretty new) which made it easy for a family to get ready quickly.<br\/>Therefore, I can def recommend the place if you want to explore Sydney.\nthank you for hosting us. my feedback is as follows:<br\/>Positive- safe and secure building, great parking, excellent location. Clean bathrooms.<br\/>Negative- bring your own toilet paper, milk and coffee! Only got one roll of toilet paper per bathroom. Beds were shocking, hard and uncomfortable. Furniture looked like it came from the council pickup! Spare mattress was stained & dirty. Carpet and hard flooring need a good scrub and clean. Iron was unusable, all sticky on the bottom. Has a timer on air-conditioning so it turns off every 4 hours. I asked Dian for the code to change the air-conditioning and she ignored my message. We needed the air-conditioning overnight as there were no fans in the unit so we had to get up at night to restart the air-conditioning. Shower heads leak, light switch in entry is dodgy. Won't be back.\nDian was very helpful, and the location of the apartment was excellent\u2014close to the city and everything we needed. However, the overall cleanliness of the house was disappointing, except for the bathrooms, which were clean. The balcony had a strong smell of urine, and although I informed Dian and she promised to arrange for a cleaner, it remained dirty, so we couldn\u2019t spend any time there. Additionally, the house hadn\u2019t been vacuumed, and the furniture was old and barely functional. There wasn\u2019t even a coffee table, and the couch in the living room was far too small for five people. Overall, the house is in serious need of maintenance.\nGood sized place in a good location for our short stay. Great to have a bus stop right outside and underground parking. Spacious & comfortable, with two clean modern bathrooms.\nWe stay only 1 night for this place is close to the airport. The apartment is very basic, including furniture or other amenities. The beds are not very comfortable. No shampoos nor conditioners. The balcony, although nice view, don\u2019t have furniture to sit outdoors. It\u2019s ok for one night as we transit through Sydney. Good enough for the price.\nA lovely stay! Beautiful apartment with large outdoor space, great location with really easy bus links into the city centre.\nDian's place is in a great location and the apartment was clean with a nice kitchen and bathrooms. However furniture was a bit lacking, particularly the beds that were quite uncomfortable. The main bed was so firm it didn't even dip when sitting on it which made for a terrible sleep. Couldn't get tv channels so tv was unusable. Otherwise the rest of the place was great. Aircon worked well. Walking distance to some lovely cafes and restaurants and train station. <br\/>I'd stay again if the beds were replaced.\nGreat\nExactly as expected, easy to access, great secure parking - the only drawback was the beds were quite hard, but the bedding and pillows were great\nGreat place, enjoyable stay!\nDian\u2019s place is very clean and centrally located. Some quirks, like a 1 hour limit on the airconditioning unit, a ban on cooking some food indoors (an alternative is provided for setting up outside, although it is quite odd). There\u2019s also a plethora of signs explaining what not to do, which are clear, if a bit stifling.<br\/>The bedrooms have a code lock on them, which is also unusual, for a whole-property stay.<br\/>Overall, the property was good, centrally located and convenient, and spotless, just unusual in how it is presented.\nOne of the reasons we chose this place because we rented a car so we required a private parking space. But we were really happy we did since the house was clean, the bathrooms were clean and the kitchen has everything we need. The host let us check in early too. Thanks so much for that. I definitely recommend this place especially if you have a car.\nThis place was a great base for our Sydney trip. Both bedrooms have their own bathroom, the outdoor patio was really cute, and there's this gorgeous little cafe right at the base of the building that was a great breakfast stop. Would absolutely stay there again\nDians place was a very enjoyable stay and it was close proximity to the city via Uber the stay was clean and comfortable space.\nWe had a great stay at the apartment, which was very handy and close to the airport. Nice and quiet, everyone had a great sleep. Private parking was easy and accessible as were nearby shops \u263a\ufe0f"}

{"listing_id":51714141,"comments":"Such a beautiful home! Spent a couple nights with my partner and friends to celebrate my 30th. The space is perfect for entertaining, with a well equipped kitchen and cooking facilities. The beds were super comfy, the bathrooms modern and clean, and air conditioning was super lovely to have on warmer evenings. I absolutely love the vintage colourful style, and I think the styling makes the space feel more like a home than a typical Airbnb. The neighbourhood is quiet, and you look across into the park and trees which is very calming. Such a lovely stay, thank you Angus and Courtney!\nA lovely stay in Bundeena! Angus and Courtney have thought of every little detail with nice touches such as spare beach towels, robes and slippers and a very well stocked kitchen. A great city getaway.\nMy family of 4 had a wonderful time. The house was fantastic and had all the amenities we needed to feel at home. The kitchen was well stocked, including a coffee machine and good quality beans. The beds were comfortable and the home was very quiet. Courtney and Angus were very welcoming. Highly recommend!\nOttima posizione all\u2019interno del parco e nelle vicinanze di Sidney. Due passi dal mare e dai principali negozi. Struttura con ogni comodit\u00e0 sia interna che esterna. Su misura per le nostre esigenze di una famiglia di 5 adulti.\nAbsolutely loved our stay in Bundeena. The house is styled with love and attention to detail. Wish we could have stayed longer and hope to be back soon. Thanks Courtney!!!\nCourtney and Angus place was lovely, the kitchen well-stocked , bedrooms were comfortable and toilet big and clean. There\u2019s even beach towels, parasols that were useful for the beach . There\u2019s also an outdoor shower to clean ourselves before entering the house. We were travelling with a baby and Courtney was helpful to source a travel cot for us. <br\/>This house is beautifully designed, and very close to the beach!  We would love to be back again.\nLoved the cheerful decor, vintage art deco style and comfortable furnishings. Modern appliances and architecture. Everything was lovely including the giant vase of fresh wildflowers in the kitchen. A short walk to the beautiful beaches and shops of Bundeena. The ferry a 10 minute stroll down the beach or along the footpath. Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4c\nLoved staying at Angus and Courtney\u2019s place. Everything felt very well thought-out and intentional. Will definitely be back!\nWe were seeking a peaceful, relaxing location in nature and the Royale fulfilled all expectations. We left feeling refreshed and renewed, thank you for your care Courtney and Angus.\nExactly as per photos, lovely bottle of wine on arrival. Beds, towels (shower and beach) and linens provided. Loved all the books, in almost every room! There is one bedroom (the low sofa bed with arcade game) on the ground floor, the other two bedrooms are on the upper floor. The location is perfect for playground\/skate park\/tennis courts across the road and the beach a short walk away.\nAngus and Courtney\u2019s place is a true gem! The perfect combination of quirky, cool and fun. It had absolutely everything you need for a comfortable and easy stay. It was immaculately clean, well stocked and beautifully styled with lots of additional touches to make it feel homely. It was a fabulous location - bowling club just up the road, short walk to the beach and park across the road. Courtney and Angus were accommodating, flexible, responsive and friendly- we would definitely stay again and recommend this awesome place to anyone!\nLovely house with all that you need and we'll decorated. Great to place to relax in the national park and walkable to the beach.\nThe home was incredibly well equipped with amazing style. We all felt very comfortable there and excited to be in such a beautiful space.\nBeautiful accommodations, loved the styling. Said a quick hello to Courtney, but were largely able to be independent. They had an extremely detailed book of all the nearby activities, overall a fantastic place to stay. Thanks Angus and Courtney!\nAngus and Courtney's house was so beautiful! Absolutely loved the styling which was super inspiring. We brought our 2.5yo and 10mo and they were so stoked with the playground across the road and how kid friendly the bowls club was down the road. Angus and courtney responded really quickly to any enquiries we had and gave us flexible check out which was a lifesaver with young kids. One of the best airbnbs we've ever stayed at!"}

Very clean and looked exactly like the photos. <br\/>The bed was on wheels and slid out a couple of times when I was chilling, not the end of the world but was a bit unexpected. <br\/>My only complaint was that the beautiful vintage windows are not well insulated which resulted in some street noise. <br\/>The check in code needs to be input to get into the lobby and to access the elevator. I think the check-in instructions could be a bit more clear, maybe add some photos.\nThe place was very cozy, clean and with nice decor. Especially the balcony. The location is close to public transport, but many things are walking distance. The wifi is fast and stable. The only issue with the accommodation is the noise from the street during the night. If you have light sleep it might be difficult for you. I brought a pair of good quality ear plugs and had no issue.\nWould definitely stay again.

There's ample storage space, a good-sized dishwasher, and even a vacuum cleaner, which was very handy for our long stay and made it easy to clean up after our pet.<br\/>Although we initially had some issues with the internet, the host was incredibly responsive and quickly sent someone to fix it. The building is secure and conveniently located near malls, grocery stores, and public transport. It's also just a pleasant walk away from Centennial Park or Bondi Beach.<br\/>For those planning a long-term stay, I would recommend booking one of their other units, which have access to balconies and larger windows. The window in this unit is high, which made us feel a bit cooped up, but it's not something the host can change.<br\/>Overall, our stay was fantastic, and we highly recommend Neighbourhood Rentals.\nBeautiful spot!

Comfortable, sunny, well-appointed, a delightful person a happy space, minutes to a lagoon-like harbour swim. And Manly outside the door.<br\/>Tops.\nSarah's home was exactly as pictured, and the check-in process was very smooth. The large storage space in the room for bags and other clothes was also extremely useful. Best of all, it\u2019s close to Manly Wharf, making it easy to access various places in Manly and quickly reach the city CBD via the wharf. I love cats, so seeing Sarah's cats was part of the joy of staying here. There was absolutely no odor from cat litter or the unwashed smell that dogs can sometimes have.

It is a charming 2-bedroom apartment. However, had not anticipated the dog plus, the two cats she had mentioned. One cat had long hair that permeated the place. The later arrival of a barking dog added to the mix. One cat had diarrhea and required a home visit from the Vet. The dog had thrown up in the bathroom. Pet toys, pee pads, food and water bowls aligned the common area. Street and neighbor noise was evident in guest bedroom.\nReally enjoyed my stay!

Bathroom a bit mouldy, due to age but clean and tidy. <br\/>Rest of studio was fine\namazing stay! location was great and the place was perfect!! definitely will recommend to others!\nFirst -- I should say that Andrea was very responsive and is an excellent communicator. She was quick to respond to my complains and open to feedback. I appreciate that.<br\/>The apartment is located in an old hotel. The hallways are bare and stark. The room was basic, and similarly old, but clean. There were several disappointments -- first, the shower curtain track kept falling. I told Andrea about it, and someone came by to re-attach it -- but it still wasn't fastened, and could easily fall off and potentially hitting you on the head while showering.<br\/>The shower head was also dripping noisily -- the kind of drip that you'll hear in the middle of the night. <br\/>Take note of the sofa bed -- it's very thin and you'll feel the bars and support under you. Not something you'll want to spend much time on. The main bed on the other hand, was luxurious with a firm mattress. Might just be the nicest thing in that room.\nGreat location, steps away from everything you need on a visit to Sydney. Apartment is clean and check-in was a breeze. One small issue was that the air-conditioner struggled a bit to cool the unit, but otherwise excellent stay\nGood location. Basic but has everything you need\n\ud83d\udc4d"}

{"listing_id":53991328,"comments":"It\u2019s a great place to sleep .\nVery good value for money! I stayed for a month and would stay again.  <br\/>This place is located 25 minutes away from the heart of the CBD, you can walk to a bus stop that will take you to Martin Place passing through Central Station, UTS, Darling Square, Hyde Park, and can easily connect to Bondi. <br\/>My room was very clean when I arrived and also de communal kitchen was tidy. There is supermarket and nice places to eat just around the corner. <br\/>I would highly recommend to solo travelers and couples traveling on a budget!\nThe room is very small, and noticeably smelled of cigarettes. it was incredibly expensive and incredibly depressing. come prepared with your own towels, dish soap, shower gel and all the air refresheners you can find.\nThis review is worth reading to those who are planning a trip to Sydney with a small budget and short stay. This by far is the worst accomodation we have stayed in.  I had messaged the lady a day before we arrived in Sydney to advise we would be arriving around 11pm as we have a late flight. She responded and said 11pm was OK. I then gave her a courtesy msg once we arrived in Sydney to let her know we will be a little later. She said ok. RIGHT... as soon as we arrived to the accomodation we received an incredibly rude welcome from the lady. She was so cold and bitter towards us because we arrived only a little over the estimated time which I advised her of prior. We didn't receive any greeting and she proceeded to say something like \"Don't book here if you come this late stay somewhere else...ALSO pay the $100.00 deposit so I can give you your key\".  Firstly, where do you get off speaking to your guest like that. You are the host and your hospitality was appalling. I see that as a negative reflection of yourself and  If you don't enjoy what you do for work, I suggest you look at a different industry because you should not treat people that way, and give someone that kind of experience. I make this review now to give people a heads up and in the hopes that this will teach the lady something. How would you feel if it was your first trip to a different city and you were greeted like that. You'd feel terrible. THE very first person you make contact with is so unpleasant and you literally just got to Sydney. Learn how to be more empathetic and understanding because sometimes people are not in control of situations for arriving late. Wila is rude.  So that was the arrival. The room had a  musty unclean, stale, and possibly mouldy smell, which was unbearable to sleep in. I understand that its a budget hotel but I'm certain you need to meet housekeeping standards which seem clearly neglected. I've also read previous guest reviews about the cleanliness  and your responses are absolutely unacceptable. Its actually a health and safety risk if you leave it unattended. The carpets were dirty, the Bed itself smelt horrible, makes me wonder if they clean the sheets after each stay. Won't be surprised if they don't. I really don't care how cheap the accomodation is per night it should always be FRESH  & CLEAN. The bathroom sink and shower head were disgusting and mouldy. You cannot leave a shower head that dirty its actually concerning. Soap scum and mildew are all over the shower screens. There are warning notices everywhere about the shower steam etc setting off the smoke alarms and fan motors breaking if left on too long. How about assess or  replace the motors if they are that temperamental. Having signs in your face advising that you are liable and it is at your discretion to pay fines if any damage is done, is such a buzz kill.  I read a review that suggested the management are only money minded and I couldn't agree more. Also they don't advertise this BUT THEY SHOULD..... you share a balcony with another room . Hopefully they don't put you next to some one like we had. We had to share with some rude dick head who's vocabulary consist of profanity all night long. So many weirdos up in that joint. We stayed out as long as we could just to avoid all of it. I recommend you DO NOT stay here and take your money elsewhere. Know your worth. I've stayed in so many budget accommodation places where I could have happily paid more for but I guess this one is definitely not one of them.  Uncomfortable, unpleasant and yuck.  Couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Delux queen unit absolutely far from it mate.\nDecent budget hotel in good location & super close to Leichhardt\u2019s Norton Street. Try book room 215 if you can - it has a great city skyline view and an outdoor terrace. Generally clean but carpet\/rug should be cleaned or replaced.\nAlways a pleasant stay! Comfortable bed, great shower and convenient location. <br\/>A+++\nThe kitchen wasn't very clean but the rest was nice. The location is just right next to a mall and you can catch a bus to Sydney by 1 min walk.\nConvenient and comfortable for our short stay. Well located with ample services nearby. Easy check in. Can recommend and would stay again."}

A beautiful, quiet location in a lovely old building, in easy walking distance to restaurants, cafes, and transport. Staff are very friendly and I cannot fault them at all. The room was very small though and does need a little freshening up, but it was still serviceable with a comfy clean bed and good amenities. The smallness of the room is also made up for by the communal areas (the downstairs sitting area is peaceful and picturesque; and the upstairs outdoor terrace is a nice little spot if you want some fresh air). Check-in was smooth, with the hotel ensuring I had proper instructions ahead of time in case I was running late. Overall, while I wouldn't say the room itself was worth the price I paid, I wasn't too fussed considering the location.\nGreat location.

Just grab a bus and in 17 min you're right in the CBD. There is a little bit of noise at night because of all the cars passing by, but it's tolerable."}

There is a beach 2 minute walk away and a bus top just around the corner, the apartment was spotless and comfortable.\nA beautiful little hime from home right in the coast of Malabar. Had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, absolutely loved our time here and Jenny and Lance were great, helpful hosts\nA great stay right near the Malabar rock pools and plenty of restaurants surrounding. Very tidy, very clean and highly recommend\nReally lovely cottage in a quiet and charming pocket of Sydney. Jenny & Lance have done a great job and I highly recommend this place if you want something a bit sheltered from the city.\nA lovely cottage , fully equipped with modern household items, Jenny has thought of everything for any type of stay. On street parking, walking distance to the beach and a lovely cafe down at the beach. Close to bus stops and an overall lovely area. Very suitable for couples or single person. Would stay again.\nWell equiped, comfortable accommodation in a nice quiet, private location within walking distance of beach and walking areas.  A great location for us to be close to family in Maroubra.\nThis was the perfect spot for my boyfriend and I while visiting Sydney. We wanted to be close enough to the city to reach it easily by public transport, but away from the hustle and bustle and closer to beach + nature. It\u2019s a beautiful suburb just steps away from a public beach and many nice parks with hiking trails. Lance and Jenny were great- Lance even gave us a ride to the light rail station one day when he saw us walking to the bus stop in the rain!\nWonderful stay. Excellent communication. Had an awesome time with my daughter.\nSpent 5 days at \u201dthe cottage\u201d and loved it! Jenny and Lance were great hosts and they let us store our luggage  while we waited to check in. The neighbourhood is nice and we were able to utilize the ocean pool which is about a 10 minute walk away. Public transportation(bus) was right around the corner and easy to use. Home away from home!\nLoved our stay in Malabar!\nExcellent location, 5 minute walk to Malabar beach which is stunning!<br\/>Bus stop down the road, takes around 45 minutes to the city. <br\/>Check in was seamless and easy!<br\/>The place was clean and the outdoor seating area was lovely on those sunny mornings. <br\/>We would definitely return \u263a\ufe0f"}
{"listing_id":559625799922519268,"comments":"This apartment had an underground allocated parking which was a big plus as its really hard to find a place with parking.\nHere\u2019s the English version of your review:<br\/>---<br\/>We had a very pleasant stay at this Airbnb! The location is excellent, with plenty of options for dining and shopping nearby. Public transportation is also easily accessible, making it very convenient to get around.<br\/>The host was very friendly, and the check-in and check-out process was smooth. The place was clean and tidy, and overall, we felt very comfortable during our stay.<br\/>There are, however, two minor areas for improvement: the internet speed was a bit slow, which might be inconvenient if you need to do a lot of work, and the showerhead was a bit tricky to keep fixed in place. But these were not major issues.<br\/>Overall, this is a great place to stay, and we had a wonderful experience!\nGreat location and nice little place for a couple. Instructions from host about check in and out very clear and friendly. Note the place is in fact a hotel room. Not a problem really but the listing description doesn\u2019t mention this fact. Overall a great deal in a great location. Thanks!\nGreat apartment and host. Comfortable bed and powerful shower. Washer and dryer. We walked to all the tourists attractions around 3.2 km one way.\nThis place is good for a single or a couple who want a short stay close to Central\/Redfern but also require a car space.\n.\nDom's place is fantastic for a value for money place.  Right on the city doorstep.  Safe, secure and easy to get to.  I highly recommend Dom's place\nDom\u2019s place is sweet, cosy, clean and quiet. It is an easy walk to other fun neighbourhoods too.\nComfortable apartment, close to Redfern and Central Station. Especially like the fully equipped kitchen where we cooked most of the time with produce purchased from nearby supermarket. overall cleanliness is superb.\nGreat location, with bonus of underground parking included. Walkable to Newtown, Surrey Hills and Sydney Opera House. Apartment itself is a little older than we expected, but was really clean and looked just like the pictures. Everything included that you need for a self catering stay. Gym was well equipped with plenty of space - dumbbells up to 20kg. Didn\u2019t use the pool. Great coffee shops just round the corner. Would recommend.\nDom and team were super responsive and great hosts. The place is well setup, comfy and in a great walkable location to so much, including Glebe, Central and even downtown CBD if you like to walk. Chippendale has a lot to see in itself and the apartment is just around the corner from Brickfields which is an awesome bakery and coffee shop. The apartment has lovely deck to enjoy as well.\nMe & my husband had a great stay at Dom\u2019s place. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and just as described. The location was convenient. I\u2019d definitely recommend this place and would love to stay here again. Thanks for a great experience\nThank you for the great stay Dom!

There was some dust around, some uncleaned drawers, and a couple of expired items in the fridge - one dressing bottle had expired in 2022. This came as a surprise, seeing as the other reviewers mentioned an immaculate place, so I guess it was just our misfortune, an isolated incident.<br\/>All in all, I would return to this apartment, as it was a lovely place to spend half a week in Sydney, offering amazing value for the location and ample indoor and outdoor space."}

But overall, it suited our purpose and we had a great time.\nGarden not clean and facilities seems old. Kitchen equipment not enough.

The property's location was perfect, making our trip even more memorable.\nTim as a host was a great!<br\/>The apartment looked like how it was described in the listing and we felt comfortable there from the first moment we walked in. He accommodated some request we had easily. If you looking for an easy place to stay  about 20 min away from downtown Sydney by bus, this is it.\nThe apartment smelled like cat urine and cats. The apartment reminded me of a hospital room. It is not two bedrooms, it's one bedroom, with a sliding door blocking off what is described as a second bedroom. The apartment was developed by Meriton, much better to just stay in a Meriton hotel room where there is accountability for how well the rooms are kept. Do not stay.\nGreat host and great place.\nNice apartment within easy walking distance to shops and restaurants and cafes. All amenities that you need and Tim is a good responsive host. Easy Uber pick up as well to explore more areas of Sydney and a parking space if self driving.\nTim as a host is very friendly and very responsive, easy to communicate with.

This is my first time getting an airbnb nevermind first time in Australia and it was a smooth experience!\ngreat place for vacation\nOverall, it is a good apartment within the new neighbor of Sydney. Zetland is close to two schools so shopping center is close but subway line is quite far, only public transport close by is bus. <br\/>Check-in: well-detailed check in guidance is provided, no hassle<br\/>Cleanliness of the place: on the surface everything looks clean, but if you look closer signs of neglect is very evident, I.e. kitchen sink, garbage bin, outside, and the bed is in a worrying state (unstable and cheap). Upon checking in, the default bedding blanket is a felt blacker of questionable cleanness tucked within two \u201cdirty looking\u201d cheap sheets\u2026 many details etc <br\/>Host: easy to communicate, refund 1 day upon requesting to check out early. <br\/>Not worth the price at all in my opinion\u2026 apartment appears smaller than in pictures, apartment use only very cheap furniture (unstably structured and unpleasant to interact with)\u2026 <br\/>Overall, definitely a sub-par experience compared to other Airbnbs we\u2019ve used in thus far\n\u633a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf \u697c\u4e0b\u5c31\u662fColes \u8fd8\u6709\u4e9a\u8d85 \u751f\u6d3b\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf\nThis place was lovely!

It\u2019s rare to find a place that feels both luxurious and cozy, but Salty Dog is exactly that. The decor is stunning, the views are breathtaking, and every corner of the space is designed to make you feel at home.<br\/>Judi and James, thank you for creating such a magical space! Your hospitality and warmth made this stay unforgettable, and we can\u2019t wait to come back.\nMy second time here and still as amazing as the first<br\/>So relaxing and peaceful <br\/>If you need somewhere to lift that weight off your shoulders this is the stay for you <br\/>Love coming here again just wish I\u2019d stayed longer<br\/>Thankyou for another wonderful stay Judi \ud83c\udf3cx<br\/>Hope to be back \u2764\ufe0f\nThe most wonderful place to stay, we had the best time on the boat in the middle of the harbour. Incredible attention to detail and small touches, the living space was just beautiful. Judi was a great communicator and incredibly welcomed. Really hope we get to come back again soon. Thank you!\nThis was our second stay at the Salty Dog Newport, and it was just as incredible as the first! This place is truly a unique experience\u2014 beautifully designed, and appointed. The attention to detail and the thoughtful touches throughout make it feel lux and cosy at the same time. Waking up to the sound of the water and enjoying the stunning views is simply magical. Hosts Judi, James and Will are fantastic, ensuring everything is seamless from start to finish. Our only regret is that we didn't book another night.\nWe had a wonderful stay on this floating house. Friendly, helpful hosts. Beautiful spot, lovely house. Very relaxing and you'll feel you've gotten away yet easy to get to.\nThe salty dog is hands down one of the best place we have ever stayed out! Judi and her family created a magical place for people to come and wind down and be in the moment. Surrounded by the beautiful ocean and being able to see the dogs at the dog beach was breathtaking! My partner and I spent our 8 years anniversary here and we wish to come back soon already! Judi does an amazing job to make sure everything you need is already there at the salty dog. I highly recommend the salty dog!!\nJudi was a great host of a truely unique home. Everything was perfect\nThis place is just so special the photos do not do it justice. When I think it\u2019s the same price as a 5 star hotel it puts those hotels to shame with the uniqueness and level of detail. We cannot wait to come back !!!!\nI couldn\u2019t fault the Salty Dog. Absolutely incredible spot for a night or two away. Judi was an incredible host, so so friendly and hospitable. We even left a pair of pants and she has shipped them to us free of charge! Thank you Judi, couldn\u2019t recommend this spot enough.\nOur stay was perfect, the house is immaculate and Judi was so helpful and responsive. Would recommend this unique experience to anyone!\nNo notes! The Salty Dog House Boat was everything we were hoping for. The place is designed perfectly from styling to amenities. Stayed on a hot day and a beautiful cross breeze kept the place cool. Gorgeous views all around. Judi is an amazing host. So proactive with information. Generous with her time and with what is provided with compliments. Will definitely above staying here again.\nThe Salty Dog was beyond my expectations. My daughter and I had a beautiful weekend chatting, swimming, playing games, rowing the boat, eating and relaxing together. It was easy to get to shore to explore the beach and we went to the pub for lunch. The house is stunning and well equipped with everything you need. The dog beach near by provided endless entertainment and delight.  Judi went above and beyond with information and supplies! We would love to come back again one day. Thank you.\nTo say this was one of my favourite Airbnb experiences would be an understatement. Judi and her family are exceptional hosts - clear communication and easy. The design of the Salty Dog is inspired and they have left no detail unconsidered. Most beautiful breakfast, thoughtful amenities and design elements. I cannot wait to go back. Seriously an amazing experience.\nSuch and amazing pace to stay and we could have asked for a better host.<br\/>Judi was quick to respond to any questions and had such a friendly helpful manner"}

Walking distance to everything Bondi Beach suburb and South Bondi has to offer. It was really comfortable with all the amenities we needed. Thanks again Jess\nThe unit was clean and well styled. <br\/>We specifically paid a high price because the description specifies free car parking on premises. It says it twice. So we were disappointed to be told we just needed to find a spot on the street which ended up being blocks way. It\u2019s also on a uhill that needs to be considered. <br\/>So because of this we thought it was overpriced.\nBeautiful home with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The shower pressure was amazing, the kitchen was well-equipped and Jessica was a helpful and lovely host. The outdoor space was a great addition and the bed was super comfy.\nJess\u2019 place was so lovely, and it had everything we needed.

A few updates here and there would help make the place even more attractive home.\nGreat accommodation and location.\nGreat spot, clean and easy house.\nExtremely friendly and responsive host. Walking distance to tons of great Sydney attractions. Practical and comfortable home.\nGreat location and spacious sleeping arrangements\nAlthough it was only short walk to darling harbour, we had 3 kids under the age of 7 so it wasn't feasible for us especially with all the other planned activities. Hence, we opted for the 1 min walk to the bus station on Harris street that got us all around town. Super convenient and easy to navigate the public transportation system in Sydney. <br\/>The home itself is quaint, it worked out fine for our family but it wasn't exceptional. Great closet space. The queen size bedrooms have glass doors that do not lock but they are heavy and secure. The toilets and the room they're in are tiny, made it hard for my 6' and 6'4\" family members. The kitchen had a minimal amount of cooking utensils and small amount of dishes\/bowls\/pans, which made making a full dinner a bit tough but again, we made it work.<br\/>Host is responsive and with great communication.

It is incredibly well located, close to lots of amazing things to do, and food. I was amazed at how central it is, yet quiet! We loved the courtyard, and were so grateful we found a place large enough for our group of friends, and pet friendly so we could bring our dog for a big city adventure. <br\/>I\u2019m incredibly grateful a parking permit was available (which I believe mightn\u2019t always be possible) because it was SO convenient which is rare for Sydney. <br\/>The only very minor down side, is we checked in on a Sunday after another booking, and the bins - which ISN\u2019T the hosts fault given the size of the bin compared to house - were full when we arrived. <br\/>This was a minor inconvenience, but worth noting to others as we found bagging our rubbish as we went, not over-filling the kitchen bin & keeping it tidy meant it was a non-issue on check-out."}

All the bedrooms were equipped with spare blankets, but Brenda still reached out to check if we needed extra layers when the weather turned cool. The bus was a short walk away and it came frequently. We took our own DVD player, which was easy to connect. The pool was right at our door, although we didn\u2019t have the weather to use it much.

One of the cosier apartments I\u2019ve stayed in, in Sydney. The amenities were okay but could do with a refresh. Nespresso machine was great. Beds were comfy, pillows good. TVs worked but were slow. Wi-Fi around 45mbps. Shower was good and strong. Nice bathtub. Location is excellent and quite quiet for central Coogee. There are fans and heaters depending on the weather, but no AC. Communication was good, only one instance where they didn\u2019t have the key to the mailbox so they asked me to pay for it to be forced open if I needed to receive mail - for 1+month long stay this is pretty unacceptable, so a star is removed.\nFantastic apartment and location!\nGreat spot\nExcellent location and was seamless with service\nBeautiful apartment in great location <br\/>Comfortable and clean <br\/>Although a bit dusty on some surfaces in bedroom\nWe had a great stay at Coogee.

The apartment is cleaned to a very high standard. We found the apartment did get very hot (stayed in summer) and it doesn\u2019t have AC, but it does have two ceiling mounted fans which helps a little. Great little coffee shop next door along with Cole\u2019s supermarket and chemists should you need one all in a 2 minute walk of the apartment.\nGreat Accommodation and clear communication\nI had a very nice stay in the accommodation. The location is perfect and the view to the Opera House and Harbor Bridge is fantastic. Everything I needed was there and there is lots of space in the flat.

I was lucky to find a resident of the block who walked me down the street across the road to a Bush where the key was chained onto pole. I had heavy bags scorching heat and my neice who has is disabled with me. I was extremely cross and frustrated. Also I was told by that lady air bb not allowed in the building??this worried me as everything seemed cloak and dagger.

Overall a good experience with very responsive hosts.\nWe had a comfortable stay at Henry's place in Zetland! A nice area with lots of food options and a small shopping centre within walking distance, and the apartment itself was very quiet and relaxing. The beds were ok, comfy enough to get a good nights rest on, and the only real complaint we had was the bathroom was not fully cleaned by the cleaning service after the last guests, and a clump of hair was left behind in the shower, but Henry was quick to respond and offer for it to be taken care of. There is free 2hr street parking available, and we were always able to get overnight parking close by. Thanks so much :)\nGreat place"}
{"listing_id":643248782942426288,"comments":"We had a pleasant stay. The host was very communicative and the apartment is in a lovely complex in a great neighborhood. They did cancel our early check in at the last moment. It was very inconvenient given we had traveled long haul with young children but I understand these things happen. We were very disappointed after checkout they attempted to charge us for additional cleaning. This was entirely unwarranted and soured an otherwise nice stay.\nAll great with the stay\nGreat communication and flexible checkin much earlier than usual (after long international flight) for only a small extra fee\nTres bon sejour, emplacement ideal, rien ne manquait dans l appartement et nous avons appr\u00e9cier la piscine et la salle de sport.

Suzi met us and walked us through the property which was welcoming. Air conditioning would have been nice.\nThe place is lovely and located in a really leafy, peaceful suburb that has every at it's doorstep and not a far walk from the CBD. The size of the apartment is very comfortable and is very well presented with a well equipped kitchen and all of the laundry facilities. There is a lot of natural light as the apartment faces east, which is lovely. There is no air-conditioning in case that is an expectation. <br\/>Overall the apartment is great and I had a good experience.\nNice soft Bed\nWe were very happy with this apartment and enjoyed spending time in it. It is in a very well maintained complex, and was quiet (on the terrace and with the windows and doors open there is some traffic noise, but not enough to bother us). The apartment is well set up and furnished and was generously provisioned. The apartment itself is not brand new, and is a little dated , but for this price point it represented good value, and had everything we needed, including a good washer and dryer. The nearest light rail station is about 10 minutes walk away, and the nearest train station is about 15 minutes walk. There are 2 supermarkets about 2 minutes walk away (Aldi and Coles). All in all this was an excellent stay for us, and we'd gladly return.\nOverall I had a wonderful stay at this flat in Redfern. The location is incredible, close to lovely cafes and pubs- so many of which are dog friendly which us a huge plus for me and my mini schnauzer Ziggy! The apartment itself was super clean, and had everything we needed for a 6 week stay. The kitchen is fully stocked which is ace. I will flag there is no air conditioning which was ok for us, a little difficult on the few hotter nights we had but not a real issue. Also no smart tv function which was surprising but we just bought our own chrome cast. The management company\u2019s communication was a little confusing, and one incident that happened at the end of my stay was not dealt with well on their behalf. The owner let himself in to the apartment one morning when I was about to get in the shower which was really quite a shock for me as you can imagine, and though he was a very nice man, there was barely an apology from them despite them being at fault.\nHad a great stay here while working nearby. The check in process was easy, and the apartment felt safe to come home to, late after a shift. The living space was modern, and clean. The bed was very comfortable, and despite being near the M1, couldn\u2019t hear a thing. Great sleep, and great communication from Maison Nets.

Sufficient amenities and nice touch of snacks, tea and coffee. Would not mind returning in the future. Tim was an excellent host.\nThe Rhodes property was as described. Very clean. Easy to get to the shops or train station<br\/>Really appreciated having a car spot and allowing my dog to stay with the family.\nHad a great stay here.

The upstairs space is great but warm in high summer if you can\u2019t open the windows (which we didn\u2019t \u2026 I think we struck a noisy cicada season, so opening the windows wasn\u2019t an option)<br\/>It\u2019s a few minutes from the ferry wharf to the house, and if you\u2019re carrying more than a few supplies it\u2019s worth noting that there are trollies just on the land side of the wharf, and some of these are marked for public use<br\/>We hope to come back\nWe were blown away by how magical our stay at Mackerel Beach was. The place was much more wonderful than the photos and description. The beds were incredibly comfortable which is rare for a holiday rental. All the mod cons you need but you are staying in the middle of nature! <br\/>It helps to be organised for taking groceries over, but also easy if you are there for a longer stay to pop back to Avalon to grab supplies. <br\/>There wasn\u2019t much we didn\u2019t love about our stay and we can\u2019t wait to come back. James and Christina were also really lovely to deal with. A real gem! \ud83d\ude0a\nA most pleasant way to enjoy the delights of Mackerel Beach, the house has a very open feeling and is nicely maintained (also fun to share the front yard with friendly wallabies and bush turkeys).

Not a reason to not stay, but sharing for any light sleepers out there!\nLocation is absolutely perfect to enjoy Bondi Beach, as well as being right next to a bus stop that links to Bondi Junction and Sydney.<br\/>Communication was really easy, and the hosts were more than happy to answer any questions we had.\nBeautifully renovated apartment right by North Bondi.

It had a lovely cafe and gourmet grocer underneath so we had everything we needed right there. <br\/>The apartment has been renovated nicely and is exactly as pictured. Check in and access via the digital door code worked really well for us as we arrived late at night and never had to worry about keys. The beds were too firm for us but everything else was great.

Well looked after. Good location.\nWow! What an amazing experience we just had. Loved it! \ud83e\udd70 <br\/>Not only is the location one of the best you possibly could get in North Bondi- just a few minutes walk from the famous Bondi Beach and all other amazing spaces you find around it, it is also just located on top of a very nice cafe with delicious food and friendly staff, next to it an amazing pizza joint which in turn is adjacent to a local grocer with all you could need. <br\/>It\u2019s only a bus ride and then a short yet amazing 15 min ferry ride from the heart of Sydney! <br\/>But most importantly, the apartment is beautifully decorated, all amenities you wish for are available, beds and all furniture very neat and comfortable, and the entire space spotlessly clean!<br\/>The entire family- both adults and children- loved the space and found it really relaxing and convenient.<br\/>If we would return to Sydney we would for sure book this place again and can recommend everyone aiming for a relaxing and enjoyable Bondi\/Sydney stay to do the same!\nEndroit id\u00e9alement plac\u00e9 \u00e0 bondi beach avec la proximit\u00e9 des bus pour se rendre dans down tr\u00e8s facilement.

The apartment is easy walking distance from everything Avalon has to offer.\nA very relaxing place to stay with a view that is unbeatable. Sharon was very helpful and easy to communicate with.\nWe absolutely loved our stay at Sharon\u2019s - a beautiful apartment with stunning views right opposite the beach and 2mins walk to cafes, shops, restaurants and Woolies.  The apartment was clean, beautifully furnished and had everything we needed including plenty of things for cooking which we did a lot as staying wirh two young kids. Friendly neighbours and accessible block. Would highly, highly recommend it.\nThe best location in the best suburb in Australia. Sharon's place combines million dollar views with all of the mod cons and comfort and only 2 mins walk into Av village. 5 star place to stay.\nWe had a wonderful stay in Sharon\u2019s gorgeous apartment. <br\/>The apartment itself is beautifully renovated and elegantly curated, yet warm and welcoming.  <br\/>The location and view - as well as the atmosphere of this original beachside apartment block is iconic. <br\/>There is everything you could<br\/>possibly need provided for a relaxing stay with an outlook that is completely stunning. The view of Avalon Beach is breathtaking. <br\/>The kitchen is so well equipped and the ocean breeze is refreshing when it comes up. <br\/>We felt privileged to enjoy this experience over Christmas with family nearby. <br\/>Thank you Sharon for sharing your apartment and welcoming us so warmly.\nIt's a stunning and relaxing location. My colleagues thought it was a fake Zoom background image\nClose by everything and the view is amazing\nWe loved staying at Sharon's place. The apartment was exactly as shown in the photos - beautifully decorated. The place was very clean and smelled fresh too. Sharon had thought of everything one could possibly need - from the kitchen accessories to the deck chairs and a folding table and trays to enjoy your morning breakfast or an evening glass of wine out on the balcony, and fluffy beach towels to take to the beach. To top that, the wow factor was the unobstructed view of avalon beach from the apartment, and it was a 5 min walk into the village or to the beach.  Thank you Sharon, we wish we could have stayed for longer!\nGreat location with an amazing view of the beach. Very easy to walk into town with shops and restaurants on your doorstep. The key pad entry also made it really easy for our party to come and go without worrying about keys!\nEnjoyed the two nights.  Very clean and tidy and well described.  Great location and views.

Classic coffee in the car park out front is a must for coffee lovers! Will be back!\nSuch an incredible apartment located in the best spot of Avalon. We loved walking to the beach every morning, the kids absolutely loved that we could walk and there was a park right in front. Also walking distance to the Main Street, you really don\u2019t need to drive anywhere as everything you need is there. The classic coffee van was so handy and great coffee in the morning. Sharon was a great host, the apartment was so clean and spacious for a family of 4. There is no parking on site however we still managed to get an all day park everyday so that was great! Hoping to visit again, such a perfect spot :)\nSuch a great location, beautiful view. Walk up the hill in the morning to get a coffee from the coffee truck. All the locals are there."}

Quick walk to groceries and shopping :)\nGreat location near the beach and lots within walking distance. The apartment is as pictured. Recommend those not familiar with Australia in the winter to pack warmly for indoors as well.\nA great place literally by the beach - the location is perfect. Lots of great cafes nearby, plus a grocery store in a walking distance - very convenient.<br\/>Ideally this is a place for 2 guests <br\/>or a 2 guests with a toddler: if you expand the sofa, there is not enough space overall.<br\/>Other reviews also mentioned 3rd floor without the elevator - nothing super critical though.<br\/>There was some clutter in the shower drain and generally the place could have been cleaner, but again, nothing critical for a beach+sand apartment.<br\/>Lots of amenities and lots of efforts are put into small details.<br\/>All in all - great place to stay, location is unbeatable.\nThe location is very strategic. The place  has everything you'll need, even a washer (no dryer but has clothes drying rack), good functioning portable heater (we went in June).<br\/>But just beware that it's on the 3rd floor with no lifts. So if you have trouble lugging your bags up 3 floors, this wouldn't be for you.\nLoved my stay in Bondi! The apartment is super modern and comfy, and you cannot beat the location. Host instructions and communication were super clear and proactive. Would highly recommend!\nThis place is nice and cosy, beautifully and tastefully decorated on the inside even though it is only an old apartment. The best part of the place is that it is very close to the Bondi Beach. Nic and Jonna had kept us informed on instructions and provided us with basic kitchen utensils, some essential groceries like salt pepper, sugar, oil etc which made it very useful. There was plenty of bathroom essentials too. Overall all good. Place could do with proper heating for winter. Had trouble on the first day finding and using the portable heaters. The other downside was , we were not able to leave the bags and we had to check out by 11 AM. Nick let us check out late by 12 noon. But since we had big bags it was a big inconvenience for us to carry it around as our flight was only at 6:30 pm. The place will be a definite must visit for summer!"}

He provided us with everything we could need in the apartment including clean cutlery, dishes, glasses etc, and nice hair and body wash in the bathroom.<br\/>The room is as pictured, comfy bed & very tidy, but it is small and doesn\u2019t have a lot of storage for big suitcases.<br\/>The downside of the apartment is having no aircon, it gets very hot in the room. You are provided with a fan but it doesn\u2019t really help unless you are directly infront of it.<br\/>Another thing to note is that cockroaches got into our room via a vent on the wall as there is no mesh covering on it.<br\/>Overall would recommend this apartment as the location is amazing. Thanks Fabiano \u263a\ufe0f\nThe view over the surrounding buildings was dissatisfying I was hoping for a beach view. I most likely didn\u2019t do my homework properly and assumed the one block back from the beach would have a view. The instructions to get inside were excellent however and simple to follow.\nIt has a great location but no aircon, which makes it difficult to get around the hot temperature.\nWe had such a lovely stay at this apartment. The location was excellent. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Fabiano remained very attentive to any queries we had throughout our stay. Will definitely book here again when I return to Bondi.\n-\nThe place is in the best location. <br\/>My only problem was the lack of AC. I had very hot nights and the window is pretty small so the fan was not enough. I didn\u2019t realized in the description that didn\u2019t have AC. But I feel like in the summer is necessary. It\u2019s a small room so I think it\u2019s go for one person.\nPerfect little place for a few nights stay right next to the beach.\nGreat location\nWorked out great - bit awkward if you have a lot of luggage - as lift is permanently broken. A tad awkward getting the key if you arrive in the dark - you'll see an array of key locks - but the host does some neat little images to show you step by step - however I still ended up walking around the carpark trying to find the door! My bad!  The place aint cheap - but nothing is cheap in this area - so it is what it is. <br\/>All in all - satisfied and would recommend - works great for a solo traveller looking for a bolt hole. <br\/>Cheer<br\/>Billy\nThe apartment was the way it was described and the location was great! Check-in was super easy and we had no problems finding the apartment. It was perfect for 2 nights but if you\u2018re planning on staying longer it will probably be too small. The bathroom was very small but we were provided with shampoo conditioner and shower gel, which was nice :) unfortunately the bathroom was a bit smelly - I assume because there is no ventilation so everything (also the towels) become really damp and smelly. Opening the window unfortunately didn\u2019t help :-( apart from that we had a great stay, thank you!\nThanks to Fabiano.<br\/>It was a lovely place for our short stay.<br\/>In walking distance to absolutely anything you need.<br\/>Highly recommend this spot for 2 people max!\nWhen we checked in we realized the elevator didn\u2019t work so we had to lug our luggage up two flights of stairs. We noticed the bathroom wasn\u2019t cleaned because we found hair on the wall of the shower and the floor in the bathroom and the toilet smelled bad. The place was very small for two people and not much room to accommodate for more than one night. It needs to be updated like the shower head kept on falling down and the sink was very old for the price. The positive is that it\u2019s very walkable and provides a Nespresso machine.\n.\nGreat location, close to the beach and public transportation"}

If it's helpful for others looking for a landing spot in Sydney, Ernest is a very good host and we found the location ideal for our use.  His unit was very clean and we enjoyed the spaciousness of the place as well as the nice balcony.  The location is right across from University of Sydney.  We especially enjoyed the 2 minutes walk to the bus stop as well as 15 minutes walk to Broadway Shopping Center, which has nice grocery stores.  There is also an Asian market just around the corner of this unit.  Since we love the outdoors and walking, we truly enjoyed the many parks nearby.

Would stay again next time we are in the area.\nI had a very pleasant stay. You can\u2019t fault the location - the beach, cafes and supermarket are a five minute slow waddle away so it\u2019s very convenient. The apartment has everything you might need and an extremely comfortable couch which I think is important when you\u2019re at a home away from home. <br\/>Yvonne is a great host!\nWe absolutely loved this place. It was so homely and had everything you could possibly want. It is so well equipped ... and the treats (I think we were allowed to eat them) so nice. It was such a great space to walk into at the end of each day, and to be in. One of the best places we have stayed and would definitely stay again. It really epitomises what an Air BnB should be.

Hope they have fixed the latter 2. I also hurt my shin from sharp corner edge of one of beds. We also asked them to remove the cup with metal handle as it heats up when you keep in microwave and my wife burnt her fingers (hope it is removed). Overall we enjoyed our stay as this was our first air bnb in Sydney.\nGreat location but was a bit tricky to find the carpark and then the apartment.  Very tidy apartment, just needed a few bits and pieces eg salt & pepper and extra tea towels but would recommend if you are wanting close to Macquarie and Metro.\nLoved the apartment and the location.

Stick vacuum cleaner was dirty and full of dust inside. It was not operational and falling apart, I couldn\u2019t use or fix it. TV screen is damaged and didn\u2019t work properly, with the left side of the screen showing discoloured picture. No washing powder or capsules provided for the washing machine, had to purchase our own. Showers had some mould around the silicone shower sealant on the floor. Not the best option for the money we\u2019ve paid\nThank you was a great place to stay\nOverall it was a very nice stay. The space itself was quite comfortable and the space was decent for the 4 of us. It will comfortably fit 6 people. Kitchen had adequate utensils and cutlery but it was missing basic cooking essentials such as salt and pepper.<br\/>The garage is quite small and is not directly linked to the building. We had to leave the garage door open overnight as I didn't want to risk scratching the car.<br\/>The garbage room was quite dirty and had lots of bugs and fruit flies which made throwing rubbish a bit disturbing.<br\/>The water pressure in the shower of the main bathroom could be better.<br\/>Overall, an enjoyable stay with a great location. Easy walking distance to cafes, restaurants and Woolies. Good walk to Bondi Beach too.\nEverything was beyond perfect. The accommodation is an absolute dream and highly recommended.

Great keyless entry.\nOur stay was awesome. Kahlo was a  home away from home and in a great location in Bondi. We came across a few minor Issues which Jimmy and team assisted or noted.  Communication with team was prompt.\nVery nice apartment, bright and modern, very well equipped. We had some communication with the host (re dishwasher malfunction), they were very responsive and sent a handyman over promptly. Great stay altogether!\nFunctional and easy to access apartment . Toiletries and cleaning equipment well supplied . One toilet was very small , doorknobs were missing but we managed to find them and fixed them . We left a day early\nWe absolutely loved staying here! It was super easy to get into the city, the place was clean and it was an enjoyable space to come back to and relax!

Easy enough to get an Uber into downtown Sydney, we had no use of a car while we were there.  Katherine's home was presented in spotless condition with all the necessary amenities for a 2 week stay!

Huge living spaces, lovely bedrooms and even a cubby house out the back which kept my kids entertained for hours. The house is in the best location. An easy walk (15mins) down the Bronte beach, and minutes to some of the best cafes I have tried in ages (Franks and Bellagio) were my two favs. Katherine was super easy to deal with and the house had everything you need.

The view was spectacular from the veranda and the hotel\/bar next door had a live DJ all night.  So perfect for our first and probably only trip to Australia!  The accommodation was amazing!  <br\/>We cooked in a lot the 1st week as I had pre arranged for Hello Fresh AU.  We had a 2nd week that was ordered but had a glitch with the credit card since I froze it during travel and so it didn\u2019t go through.  Kitchen was fully stocked and only had to grocery shop for a few items!  Highly recommend this as a way to make meals together with minimal waste & so delicious!<br\/>We were able to walk to almost everything from our apartment!  Public transportation can be used and is easy to get to as well.  We did all the normal touristy things and added the Mov\u2019in Bed night, Bridge Walk, Skydiving, Helicopter Tour, Boat Luncheon Cruise, Aquarium & Zoo, Sydney Zoo, Marina Museum, Manley Beach, Bondi Beach, Surfing Lessons, Icebergs Pool,  Big Bus,\nGreat place\nWe had a fantastic stay in Sydney!

{"listing_id":727028508131041088,"comments":"Thank you, we had a wonderful stay. It was the perfect comfortable base to return to after a day out exploring. Location wise, you couldn't ask for more. You are walking  distance to Oxford Street, where you will find plenty of shops and cafe's to explore - we loved the Paddington Grind for our morning coffee, we enjoyed dinner out at The Paddington and Il Baretto, both a short walk away. Also it's just a short Uber ride to other outstanding restaurant's in Surry Hills - you are spoilt for choice! <br\/>It was so easy to get to either the city or Bondi via bus 333 or Uber.<br\/>We would definitely stay again if we were to return to Sydney.\nPaddington is always a blast and not many places are in such great location. We came with friends and the house was perfect.<br\/>minutes away from Oxford street and super quiet.<br\/>House is modern and has everything one could want\nAmethyst\u2019s place was perfect for our family weekend in Sydney. It is beautifully decorated but also included practical extras like children\u2019s Panadol and pantry items. We were able to easily walk to the local cafes, markets and even the entertainment quarter. <br\/>We will happily stay again the next we\u2019re in Sydney.\nGreat place to stay for our weekend for the Unite Cup at Allianz Stadium.  Would come back.\nGreat location and great stay!\nThe only feedback we have is that there was one 1 toilet roll per bathroom for a 5 day stay.\nWe had an amazing stay in Paddington at this fab Air BnB. It will be hard to beat this! We immediately felt at home with clear instructions and we were met with a spotless home. It went beyond our expectations.  Only a three minute walk to the bus stop (route 333), a fab IGA and the super Paddington high street.  You won\u2019t even need to leave Paddington, but if you do, you are a short spin to the city or to Bondi Beach on the 333. The house was just super. We had loads of space in the garage for our luggage, there was a great  BBQ in the terrace and best of all, it was super clean.  There was also lots of cleaning bits and toiletries which was so handy.  Thank you! Would highly recommend\nHad a fantastic time in the AirBnB\nThe apartment was beautiful and had everything we needed. The neighbourhood of Paddington was so lovely! Amethyst was also very accommodating. We needed to leave our luggage at the apartment for a couple of hours after check out and she was very kind to let us do that. Loved the stay! \u2764\ufe0f\nWe would highly recommend this property. It was extremely well presented and clean. It was an easy walk to Oxford St - where there are great shops and restaurants. It was as described and had all amenities we needed and more. Loved it!\nAmethyst\u2019s place is spotlessly clean, well equipped and in a great location. <br\/>It\u2019s in a lovely quiet street so it\u2019s quiet at night but easy walking distance to the main road and not too far to walk to get the tram into town too. <br\/>Amethyst was an excellent host with great clear directions for check in and very prompt response time. <br\/>Would very much recommend as a great base for a stay in Sydney!\nThis terrace apartment is a hidden treasure nestled as it is amongst Paddington's terraces on the sunnier side of Oxford Street. The apartment is a conversion top to bottom with a modern, high end finish. Clever use of space & thoughtful inclusions help to make the apt feel bigger than it is.<br\/>The master bedroom is really special and the bathroom positively roomy. The sun sets into the room making it a magical afternoon napping spot. Not that you have time for that with so much to do in Paddington and surrounds. <br\/>There is something very satisfying (and convenient!) in being able to drive your car into the house- saving you the 15 minute secret Paddington parking spot hunt every time you get back. BIG BONUS!<br\/>The kitchen is brand spanking new and very well appointed, and the furniture comfortable and in keeping with the modern minimalist vibes. Topping it all off, Amethyst was exceptional-highly recommended if you like modern, stylish understated places and exceptional hosts.\nFantastic Paddington location. Lovely space. Wonderful host. Would highly recommend!\nWe had a lovely stay. Prime Paddington location, very easy to walk wherever we needed to go. The house is gorgeous and extremely clean. Amethyst was incredibly responsive before and during our stay. Highly recommend!\nFantastic place. Neat, cool and comfortable. Hosts went above and beyond. Very close walks to local cafes\/pubs and the sporting arenas, particularly the SCG which we were in town for. 10\/10 and will stay again. Cheers!"}

We also walked back from the city both nights, and it was easy and safe. Wonderful cafe just two doors down, and close to the Fish Markets. A\/C in the top bedroom and one on the second level were very welcome.\nThis house is very well-priced and centrally located, with bus stops, taxi\/rideshare points, and the light rail nearby. It's an easy, 20 minute walk to the central CBD via Pyrmont Bridge. Lots of great Dining options, The Star casino, pubs, pharmacy, and supermarket are within a 5-minute walk.<br\/>The accommodation is clean but basic, with steep, narrow stairs typical of old Sydney sandstone terraces. It's ideal for solo travelers or small groups needing a central place to sleep. <br\/>Our host, George, was responsive to messages and friendly, offering an early check-in\nLocation was incredible. Amazing food just metres from the doorstep and easily walkable to attractions :)\nWent with this place because it was one of the cheaper options, really great stay! Such a great location and easy to access via public transport. Lots of good eateries and cafes around. Cute townhouse, clean and tidy. Good pressure on the shower which is always a plus! <br\/>There is some street noise at night time and the stair cases are quite narrow, but this didnt impact our stay at all.\nGreat place to spend a few nights in Sydney. Excellent little cafes literally next door and several pubs and restaurants nearby. Easy walk to Darling Harbour. Can easily recommend this place. Perhaps not suitable for those with reduced mobility as stairs are very steep\nExcellent location\nThis property was great for us to stay, close to shops, restaurants, The Star Casino, Darling harbour, Sydney CBD and public transport. It's 3 levels of clean modern apartment with compact functional kitchen and washing machine.

The location is excellent for exploring all parts of the city with many food options close by.  We would stay here again.\nLovely small place in an excellent spot! Super easy to walk to many locations and a quiet street.\nBeautiful townhouse in close proximity to a lot of things. Would definitely stay again.\nCute three story terrace house, loved how walkable it was to nearby places including Darling Harbour. Shame it didn\u2019t have parking but we ended up parking at Harbourside Wilson Park 10 min walk for $100 3 full days which wasn\u2019t too bad. George overall was professional with responses and helpful.\nAwesome location, bathroom was grimy and there was some rubbish left behind in the fridge and lounge. Also some hair in the bed. Very steep stairs but over all happy for the price. Would stay again for the location and price\nA very neat and cosy place to live. Close to local amenities. Easy to find."}

The apartment is a gem.  Wonderfully equipped, close to amenities and immaculately clean. I cannot find a single fault. I would love to be able to return in 2025.\nA perfect location for a Balmoral getaway. Carspace was essential but only for my little car (Hyundai i30) as just fit. The outdoor ground level patio was great and made the place feel cool and private. Lots to do in the immediate area as Balmoral Beach is truly a superb harbour beach.\nAlbert is a wonderful host.  Very responsive and went out of his way to ensure we had what we needed.  Smooth entry to the house and exit.  He responded to all our needs. The location was amazing for beach lovers.  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing beach stay. Thank you Albert\nThe place was easy to find and only a few minutes walk to the beach which was great.<br\/>The bathroom was ok but to get to it from downstairs you have to negotiate the spiral jstaircase which can\u2019t be done quickly unless you are a mountain goat.<br\/>The bed was surprisingly uncomfortable for the price of the stay.  A new mattress would go a long way to making the stay more comfortable.<br\/>There were 2 beach towels provided and a beach umbrella.<br\/>The sunroom would be nice in winter but was a bit warm to use in December.<br\/>I found the kitchen very basic.  There were no sharp knives which was annoying.  Also the kitchen bench did not appear to have been wiped as there were gritty bits all over it.<br\/>I was very happy with the location but I feel that there could be some improvements\u2026.\nLovely place to stay for a long weekend. So close to the beach and shops at Mosman and Spit Junction. Small but all you need for 2 people. Wonderful to have the morning sun flooding in.\nThis was my husband's 2nd stay at Albert's. The perfect location for his work in Mosman. With Balmoral Beach just down the road to restore his soul. And close to great cafes to fill his belly. Moments away from the chaos of Military Rd but Albert's place is very quite.\nThe location was amazing. Short walk to the beautiful Balmoral Beach. We swam in the ocean pool every day. The apartment was very clean and comfortable.We especially enjoyed the large sunroom upstairs and the outdoor space in the garden was cool, lush and  and very private. Buses to get around Sydney were very close and  buses took us to the ferry terminal, the main  street in Mosman or Sydney city centre. We ate several times at nearby restaurants and cafes. Must be one of the most beautiful locations in Sydney.\nThe location is fabulous - just a few minutes walk to the beach. The apartment is a great layout - quite large with a nice outdoor area. There were lots of thoughtful touches - eg quality toiletries which we appreciated.

There were lifts which was great and the apartment had everything they needed<br\/>Thank you Tee"}

Close to the main street with excellent restaurants and coffee shops. Equiped kitchen and great shower..also with a washing machine. Very impressed.

Being close to the airport, the noise from planes was quite loud, especially early in the morning.\nGreat and warm hospitality. The house is spotless.\nEverything is fine\nF\u00fcr den Preis eine sehr gute Unterkunft. Ein wenig unsauber, Mikrowelle hat nicht funktiokiert und nachts gepiepst, aber nach dem ausschalten war das kein Problem mehr. Ansonsten alles vorhanden, Zheng ist ein sehr netter Mann der einem gerne entgegenkommt und hilft. Nah an Busverbindungen in viele Richtungen und Zugverbingung ins CBD. W\u00fcrde Zheng auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen.\nZheng is extremely attentive and always makes everything to assure you\u2019re having a good stay, and for me that\u2019s definitely a differential\nBed was too small for me (I'm 1.83m tall), room had a bad smell and bathroom had some mould.\nZheng was a fantastic host that provided flexibility with checkout. Stay here if you need a quick night near the airport\nThe property looks way worse than in the photos. Had I known, I would have picked another accommodation option. it wasn't a good value. The place has no ambiance and all the windows face walls. <br\/>The cleaning of the common areas (such as the fridge) was patchy. <br\/>I had to pay for having a heater in my room if I didn't want to have it freezing cold and risk getting sick. The heater seemed like a fire hazard due to its very poor quality and condition.<br\/>Everything else was fine, including the Wi-Fi, the kitchen, the living room, the amount of space and storage, the communication, the access and the area.\nZheng was a very responsive and helpful host. Convenient accommodation, close to airport, clean and affordable.\nThis is a good and beautiful place. Nice experience\ud83d\ude18\nExcellent location, nice tidy room and Zheng is very helpful and friendly.\nJason is very nice, he allowed me to check in earlier and helped me to keep my luggage after checking out. The house is clean and quiet, a private bedroom with shared kitchen, bathroom and laundry. The location is great, you can catch either bus or train to city within 20 minutes, to UNSW within 20 minutes, and to international airport within 30 minutes. There are also many restaurants along the Botany Rd near to the door. I would strongly recommand Jason and his house."}

The Airbnb was perfect for spending a few days in Sydney. It is in such a great location! A quiet road with a lovely cafe nearby, and very central to the main city centre and train station. The Airbnb itself is really lovely and well-presented. The host was very welcoming and responsive.Would highly recommend staying here!\nLoved staying at Johannes\u2019 place! Highly recommend!\nI absolutely love staying in Johanne's Airbnb's, I also feel right at home, they are always so friends and accommodating. The place was lovey, central but tucked away nicely from the noise of the city.<br\/>I will certainly return!\nWe had a great time at this apartment, which was just the right size and space for our weekend stay. The area is fantastic, with lots of great restaurants, cafes and architecture (art deco).  The only thing to be aware of is that, at least on the weekend we stayed, the neighbours were a bit noisy in the middle of the night.\nGreat location, good cafes and restaurants nearby. Close to public transport. Easy check in and comfortable accommodation. Would stay here again.\nGreat location. Amazing neighbourhood with so many good coffee shops, breakfast spots, shopping, bars and restaurants. The unit doesn\u2019t get much light in but didn\u2019t care since didn\u2019t spend much time at home it was so much to explore outside\nA home away from home! I had a lovely stay in this super convenient location. The place is beautiful, with a modern kitchen, spotless furniture and handy appliances. Communication was smooth, with a handy guide provided to help settle in. The bathroom could do with modernising to match with the rest of the place as the temperature can be quite tricky to get right in the shower, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"}

It\u2019s the perfect location, near the airport but also super easy to get downtown in public transport. We also walked to the Grounds of Alexandria, which is a must see. The hosts are very accommodating with the check in and out, they let us leave our bags in the common area so we could make the most of our days. We felt very comfortable staying there with the private entrance and the ensuite bathroom.

Big terrace to chill and chill with a book or wine. House is just close to two main train station and bus. Gleen indicated how to go into the house due that they were not at home when I arrive and everything was kind of easy. I'll book again in my next visit to Syd!\nIt was comfortable. i cooked BBQ everyday. It was great time to enjoy beef and lamb! The bus stations and subway was close to home. So there was no problem to move anywhere. thank you.\nOur 7 night stay here was very pleasant and straightforward. The bedroom and ensuite were spacious and clean. We mostly stayed in our bedroom but also made good use of the shared kitchen, which is very well-equipped. Glen and Alison were also very accommodating, allowing us to drop our bags and use common areas before check in and after check out.<br\/>Glen and Alison were away during our stay but they were still very responsive and helpful. Their housemates were friendly and unintrusive.<br\/>The location was quite convenient for our purposes of getting around the different parts of Sydney by train. Guests should be aware it is on a main road (but the bedroom faces away from this), and the beer garden of a local pub is at the edge of the balcony. We didn't find this to be an issue, it was generally fairly quiet and not really audible when we were trying to sleep.<br\/>Overall, it was a lovely stay and we recommend it to any single or couple looking for an affordable home base near central Sydney.\nGlen and Betty is very easy-going, the apartment is very close to Green Square station. This community is safe and quiet in the night, you don't need to worry about walking alone. Highly recommend it\nGlen and Alison has been a great host. The place is nice. Very quiet and peaceful. Easy to walk to the train station.\nGlen and Ali are great hosts, and their place is perfect, everything you need, a nice bathroom \/shower, access to the kitchen and laundry and a large and lovely terrace, and easy to walk to CBD or take buses; can\u2019t recommend enough, thanks again both!\nAmazing location, accommodating hosts! <br\/>Glen & Alison were great hosts, only being a door away. Alison has an awesome Lego collection & Glen\u2019s just amazing to have a chat with; very, very knowledgeable of Sydney! <br\/>The bedroom was spacious, towels are provided & the bedroom light is adjustable & most importantly, Not far away from the airport & Waterloo Metro station; only a 7 min walk for both! <br\/>Lastly, it\u2019s near a McDonald\u2019s; what more can you ask.<br\/>Con: due to being a shared apartment complex, initially hard to locate (for some) with all the gate & similar looking building you have to go through.\nGlen and others were very friendly and open to give advise. Accomodation has very good postion between airport and city center with good connection by public transport. I really appreciate comfortable bed, flexible arrival and possiblility to wash our clothes.\nVery nice room with attached bathroom. Clean and also there are a lot of sockets for us to charge our phone. Suitable to work as well, overall it\u2019s great. 500m away from metro.\nGlen\u2019s house is fascinating. The location is perfect with w train stations less than 10mins walk. Bus station is very near. It\u2019s in the middle of downtown and airport. Glen and Alison are really friendly and helpful. The check in information is clear and easy to find. The room and private bathroom are extremely clean and comfortable. Glen and Alison have settled everything in order. Hope to visit Sydney and Glen\u2019s again!"}
{"listing_id":776934403044045692,"comments":"The location was stunning <br\/>The house is very streamlined and clutter free so easy to keep tidy\nCurl Curl is one of the best beaches in Sydney. The view of it from the house is incredible! We really enjoyed our stay, and had plenty of space for our large family. We loved the extra touches, like comfortable sitting places on the veranda. We love music, so finding bluetooth speakers available to connect to and listen was - for us - a very thoughtful touch. The location was great too. If you want to spend your days on the beach, this house is the perfect launching point. Besides Curl Curl, it is a short drive to Freshwater Beach, where you'll find loads of restaurants and shops (and another incredible beach). Having a nice pool was another big bonus for us. Our kids never want to leave the beach, but it's easy to convince them to head home, if we have a pool to offer them. We were sad to leave but know we'll be back for sure.\nThe house is in a great location for the beach. Less than a 2 minute walk. It is spacious, but not finished to a high standard. We were lucky the weather was cool as it would be sweltering in summer with no AC in 3 of the bedrooms plus a lot of the windows and doors don\u2019t unlock\/keys not provided. One of the pedestal fans was faulty, leaving the bunk bed room very stuffy.<br\/>We couldn\u2019t get directly out the back door to the pool - instead had to walk through the bedroom. There were no towel hooks in the bathrooms or bedrooms. No kitchen towels provided, only paper, so impossible to dry dishes. <br\/>No toiletries apart from the en suite.<br\/>The side passage to the pool is full of broken tiles, do not let children play barefoot in the garden.<br\/>Overall it was not worth the money we paid.\nOur stay at Emily\u2019s place was perfect for our families needs. We were able to walk to the surf club for coffee & breaky, go for our coastal runs, have a winter dip in the ocean and visit our family in Curl Curl! <br\/>The sound of the waves at night was extremely peaceful\u2026.. and the view!! Wow.<br\/>Emily was very responsive as a host and extremely accommodating to our needs. We would 100% stay here again.\nSuch a beautiful property in a perfect location! <br\/>We loved our stay, the place had such a lovely feel and beautiful view of the beach - which was just a short walk down the road. <br\/>Emily reached out before our arrival and was very informative and helpful which made check in and our stay a breeze.<br\/>Highly recommend Beach View Curl Curl!\nThe house was in a beautiful location with beautiful views of the beach. Thanks for a wonderful stay.\nLovely place! Hope to go back soon!\nThe house was in a great location. We were a little disappointed by some things but Emily was very kind and reassuring. A few things need updating around the house but the location is perfect and the neighbours are lovely.\nGreat location with wonderful views. The house was open and clean and the host Emily was very helpful.\nLovely house in a fantastic location with a very helpful host. Only downsides were no walking to restaurants and bars - but we did know that before choosing the house - and lack of air conditioning, except for the master bedroom and lounge. We wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay there if the temperature was any hotter really.<br\/>Had a great stay!\nGreat place.\nAwesome place , brilliant view , fantastic space for groups.<br\/>A sticky key on entry was easily solved by Emily and her generous and responsive communication.<br\/>Made the weekend away so relaxing and enjoyable.\nEmily was a great host, house was immaculate, perfect location with epic views and walking distance to the beach.\nMy family and friends loved the large, clean house, and great value for it\u2019s size. A fantastic location close to the beach, town, and convenient by bus. Emily and Zoe were quick to respond to requests and provided extra service with lightbulbs and toiletries. We would happily stay at Curl Curl Beach House on a return visit!\nWould recommend!"}

The apartment is in a great location and is well equipped with everything you need - highly recommend!\nWe made a last minute trip from Melbourne to Sydney for NYE and must say that Toni's apartment was perfect for a family getaway. The pristine location in the Northern Beaches of Collaroy was simply awesome, couldn't ask for more. Also the proximity to the beach, Manly and other northern suburbs was good. Due to the busy holiday period, we only got to stay for 3 nights but wish we could've stayed longer.

Toni\u2019s communication was brilliant and we appreciated the ability to get into the unit a little early as we were arriving from an international flight.

The condition of the property was exceptional. Flawless. Any guest would be happy here.<br\/>We really enjoyed the outside patio and spent a lot of time there.

Hard to beat the Northern Beaches. Finally, Toni was a fantastic host. Great communication with plenty attention to the details. Highly recommend.\nAmazing apartment - beautiful. Location just gold. Cafe below, beach down the road, stunning walk around park and peninsular on your door step. Loved our stay.\nExcellent appartment, very well located, clean, and modern design!

We also weren\u2019t expecting how noisy it is in the morning as the apartment is directly above a surf shop and cafe ( a very good cafe \ud83d\udc4d) Bondi wakes up very early in the morning and so both the cafe and surf shop were buzzing from quite early on .

David was very responsive and made check in a breeze.\nDavid was extremely helpful and responsive, and his place was very close to the North Sydney train station and multiple bus stops. Great restaurants and the Harbour Bridge are within walking distance as well. The only thing I would mention is that there is no in-unit Wi-Fi available, and so we had to rely on our personal hotspots to do online meetings and access the internet.

Fully stocked to cook and enjoy, between take out meals on the back patio table or cooking a big dinner inside.<br\/>Things to note, though the stay is beautiful:<br\/>- The primary upstairs bedroom is not fully private as it has a sliding fogged glass wall to cover the lofted opening. The skylight in the stairwell going up makes the room VERY bright so we slept with eye masks. The sliding door does not fully close you off from downstairs so you can hear anyone below.<br\/>- Bathrooms were great. Nice water pressure, towel warmers. <br\/>- Downstairs room only has a small window and can be humid\/stuffy. It\u2019s the most private room, but damp at times.<br\/>- Laundry downstairs was fully stocked and very useful.<br\/>Overall we loved our stay and the Glebe area as a whole. Comfortable and stylish. Ben also gave great recommendations for Glebe and Sydney. Thanks again!\nGreat location and fabulous views. Ben was very responsive to enquiries and sorted an issue with beds. House is a family home but there was plenty of cupboard space etc. Great kitchen. Industrial feel. Good for Sydney visit.\nThe house was dirty and unclean and we spent all day cleaning the linen and the house as the host was not prepared to fix the issues promptly. So this wasted a whole date not ideal at all when on holiday. <br\/>If clean the house would have been ideal, I wouldn\u2019t stay again unless host could guarantee cleanliness.\nAn incredible house with stunning city views. <br\/>Worked well for us as an interstate team travelling for work. <br\/>Beautifully presented and  Close to local shops and restaurants also."}

Would stay again.\nGreat space and extremely thorough and prompt communication, I had no questions because Kylie had covered it all. Thank you.\nKylie was an amazing host. From the moment I made the booking, right through to check out, kylie made the whole process so simple and easy. She was very fast at replying and was so accommodating when I needed to change the amount guest's I had with staying. Kylie also left cute little notes welcoming us to her place, which definitely made feel right at home. <br\/>Would happily stay at kylie's again."}

{"listing_id":817619590772906923,"comments":"The place was ok. The bed was comfortable enough. You can hear the street but it\u2019s not too loud. As other reviews have said the bathroom does need looking at. There is damp on the ceiling outside the bathroom and you can see where the wood under the bathroom door is falling away because of the water coming out of the shower. It\u2019s a useful spot because it\u2019s so accessible. Fine for 2 night stay.\nTons of restaurants, shops, train-connections around the area. Great place to stay if you also wanna visit other parts of the city. The room was clean and Megan was really friendly! Thanks again :)\nWe had a lovely stay at Megan\u2019s it was super clean and comfortable. Very affordable and we were right near the city which was amazing. Megan was so responsive to any questions i had and gave clear instructions to check in and check out. Overall had a lovely stay !\nNeat and tidy room in a vibrant area. Although he the streets were buzzing and lively the long weekend we were there, the room was quiet. The bed is comfortable, water pressure in shower is good, kitchenette is handy. <br\/>The light rail at the front door was wonderful;; but walking\/exploring the area is also great!\nWonderful place to stay, felt safe and comfortable as a solo traveler!\nGreat stay, very clean and prime location right in the heart of Sydney. Very good value for the location and space and Megan is extremely helpful and attentive. Would recommend as a budget stay in Sydney.\nPrima kamer. Schoon en netjes. Keuken is klein maar is wel bruikbaar. Badkamer is oud. Weinig plek om je spullen en handdoeken op te hangen. Douchegordijn komt niet tot aan de grond waardoor alles nat wordt. Badkamer verdiend een renovatie.\nDefinitely a very convenient place in Chinatown, so many good restaurants nearby. There\u2019s a tram stop just in front of the building, easy to go many famous attractions in Sydney. Megan is very kind, the reply to the message was timely. <br\/>Since I was staying during the New Year, I understand that there is always a premium. But I think the price I paid was worth better service, dust was clearly visible on tables and bedside tables, as well as on pillows. The bathroom was not very dry and wet separation, and ventilation was not good. But if it's just for one or two nights, I don't think it will have much impact.\n\ud658\uae30\uac00 \uc798 \uc548\ub418\uace0 \uc2b5\uae30\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544\uc694\nCentral location in the middle of Sydney\u2019s CBD. Host is friendly and responsive, photos match, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom fairly clean and size of the room is good for 2 people. <br\/>However we feel we overpaid for what we got in the end. <br\/>The A\/C which was advertised when we originally booked no longer worked, we appreciated the host giving us 2 fans in the room however with 35 degree heat and 90% humidity they didn\u2019t help much. We would\u2019ve appreciated to have been advised as soon as the A\/C stopped working so we could\u2019ve possibly canceled the booking and booked elsewhere. <br\/>Secondly the is no fan in the bathroom not anywhere to hang wet towels, and since opening the windows was not an option given the weather they did not dry properly hence stank after 2 days. When we requested clean towels they had little stains on them.<br\/>Lastly the vacuum cleaner did not work which was inconvenient as the floor was dirty and I really wanted to clean i\nSono stata bene.\nGreat accommodation, close to everything\nMegan was very responsive, and the airbnb was everything it offered\nVery Convenient place, Easy Access and Clean Room\nIt was great overall."}

{"listing_id":823420316045864450,"comments":"Recently stayed here for 10 days and it was perfect position for transport, restaurants, shopping and a dog park right behind the complex for my french bulldog !! the apartment was clean and very spacious, also the central air cond was great as it was pretty hot most of the time. I will definately stay here again when I'm in sydney.\nGreat place to stay\nThe apartment is in a perfect location - Near Westfield Parramatta Shopping Centre (where you can go by walking - around 5 minutes, and find everything - supermarkets and stores). There is also plenty of public transportation (bus, ferry and train). Another positive point is the car parking in the building - it was really convenient for us.<br\/>The kitchen, living room and bathroom were in good condition. The bedroom had a strong musty smell and the windows did not open.<br\/>The intercom rings at random, which is a problem that needs to be fixed, and the balcony had several clutters that need to be removed.\nA Cozy place with excellent location that the bnb is close to train station, bus station, a huge shopping mall and also many restaurants. You can simply get what you want with about 5 mins walking.<br\/>The bnb also provides a variety of daily necessities which makes us having a comfortable stay.\nGreat Location and Responsive Host<br\/>Pros:<br\/>Location: Convenient, close to public transport, shopping, and restaurants. (City Center- 30 mins by train, airport - 30 mins drive (toll road))<br\/>Host: Very attentive and quick to respond. Ensures that amenities provided are as per description. <br\/>View: Lovely park view from the balcony.<br\/>Cons:<br\/>Balcony Maintenance: Needs cleaning and removal of non-working items.<br\/>Bedroom Windows: Open to the common area, affecting privacy. <br\/>Kitchen cooking utensils : we just used couple of items .. mostly visited the nearby restaurants\u2026  if u wish to cook.. better to bring ur own items, or if the host wishes to replace the current ones at regular intervals it will be good. <br\/>Parking: Congested, best for small cars.<br\/>Overall, a pleasant stay.\nThe apartment is in a really convenient location close to both the Harris Park train station and also the Parramatta station and Westfield. The apartment overlooks a small park. Dong was always responsive to messages. The apartment itself is a bit older and had a few maintenance issues (e.g. the intercom beeping) that I'm sure will be sorted out before the next guest, but having a kitchen and washing machine\/dryer was very convenient for a long stay. The secure parking was also great.\nLocation was great. Convenient to shopping and public transport options as well as a variety of food options.<br\/>Secure off street parking included was a great feature for me.\nWe had a good time here, the only issue was too much bird poop on the balcony when we checked in, and kitchen stove area was not so clean also .\nVery good location and the flat is in great condition. Plenty of amenities in and around Parramatta station and the Westfield. Host was very responsive and helpful when I had any queries. Would stay here again in future and would highly recommend.\nI like this apartment is close to the train station and Westfield shopping have a nice park in front, the apartment was clean. Is a very nice place.\nGreat location with all the essentials for a comfortable stay. Great to have parking included. I enjoyed the view over the park and the sounds of the children playing.\nConvenient location, secure place.\nGood place to live. Was clean and quite. Would highly recommend.\nConvenient booking and communication  . Good experience !\ngood location, only 5 mins walk to parramatta station and shopping mall.will stay again next time"}

Overall, it was a worthwhile experience.\nAmazing\nThe house was wonderful for our large family. The pool was a hit with the kids and we had a lovely time.<br\/>We used the house as a base for heading into Sydney for the Zoo and the Harbour etc and it was a clean run down the motor way to get there so very convenient.<br\/>We had a issue with the bedroom door being locked then shut by one of the kids and you have to have a key to open the door (a little bit of a worry if a small child was locked in there), however the host was quick to reply and it was sorted. <br\/>All in all, I was greatful to find a place for our large family to be able to have a great holiday.\nWonderful stay!

{"listing_id":827233661125359590,"comments":"Central location, perfect for exploring the city (be prepared for some stairs if you decide to walk, otherwise pretty easy with public transport as well). Excellent communication with Louisa, who allowed us to arrive earlier. She also arranged a bed for our baby, which was very convenient. I highly recommend this place. Thanks for having us!\nI recently spent 2 wonderful but far too short nights at Louisa\u2019s apartment in Potts Point. Located in arguably one of Sydney\u2019s most character-filled and central locations, this art deco apartment is what I would describe as a mix of European charm with Japandi minimalism. We felt perfectly at home and had all the amenities we needed for our short stay. We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the balcony which overlooks the city which also happens to be frequented by all the local bird wildlife. The apartment is an easy stroll to the local grocer as well as a plethora of wonderful cafes and restaurants. On-street parking with a permit was a bonus- we only had trouble finding a park once or twice. I would return if I\u2019m ever so lucky to be in this neck of the woods again! \ud83d\udc95\nNous avons pass\u00e9 un excellent s\u00e9jour dans le bel appartement de Louisa qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 10-15' des lieux anim\u00e9s de Potts Point. Il y a pas mal de bons restaurants \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 et il est tout \u00e0 fait possible d'aller \u00e0 pied jusqu'au CBD, aux jardins botaniques ou \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ra.<br\/>L'arriv\u00e9e et le d\u00e9part se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s sans probl\u00e8me.\nLouisa was very kind to let us check in early and drop off our luggage as we had a very early arrival in Sydney.  My husband and I like to walk so we saw all the sights by foot from her apartment, which was not far from the water and on a very quiet street in an otherwise lively (in a good way) neighborhood.  The apartment building is locked and feels very safe.   If you're there on a Saturday, I highly recommend the farmer's market nearby for a few \"farmers\", but mostly very yummy gourmet food.<br\/>Keep in mind if you have lots of luggage there are 2 flights of staircases to go up.  The kitchen would benefit from a microwave but otherwise had anything you'd need.. The apartment is a bit stuffy with no central air but it was extremely windy when we were there and we were able to open the windows and it cools off at night.  The birds outside were entertaining with their exotic calls.  Great visit down under and wished we had stayed longer in Sydney--so much to see and do!\nGreat place to explore Sydney from. And a lovely appartment.\nLovely space, convenient location and fantastic host. Loved our stay there.\nSuch a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing house that was close enough to the city without being too busy and conveniently located right next to the bus stop. Really enjoyed staying here, definitely worth the money.\nWe loved our stay! Great, convenient location near both bus and train, and perfect neighborhood to walk and explore. Stellar food at the Apollo nearby, and Fratelli Paradiso. We loved watching the birds just outside. Def recommend!\nWe definitely can recommend Louisa's place! We really liked the location- close to the restaurants\/shops in Potts Point (bit still quiet) and also perfect if you want to have a nice walk to the city. The apartment is big,clean, has a nice bathroom with a bathtub, kitchen with all the amenities needed. The bed is really comfortable. The only thing was that the couch in the living room was a bit small and as we had to escape from the balcony (we loved it!) because of the mozzies we didn't really have a comfortable place to sit on (or put our small daughter on). The other 2 rooms were locked as we stayed there. <br\/>Louisa is a great host, communication was perfect. A big plus for the lovely neighbour who takes care of the apartment when she is not there :)\nI had a great stay at Louisa's apt. the apt was exquisite and very peaceful. I particularly liked the french influence of the neighborhood and easy to get to town.\nWe had trouble opening lock key as we were given the wrong code but Louisa had given us her neighbours no so we rang him and it got sorted. Great apartment in a lovely area. So easy get around. We didn't eat locally but Louisa gave loads of suggestions. Plenty of hot water and a lovely balcony. i would highly recommend.\nIn what other Airbnb can one peruse the collected works of Le Corbusier while lounging in an Eames armchair, before going for a leisurely walk through the nearby Royal Botanical Gardens (stopping for a stellar coffee on the way) to get to the most beautiful opera house in the world?  If ever destiny allows me to return to Sydney, I know where I want to stay.\nBeautiful suburb, within walking distance of some wonderful restaurants and the apartment itself is very clean and nicely furnished :)\n\uc219\uc18c\ub294 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc45\ub4e4\uacfc \uc8fc\ubc29\ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ud3ec\uce20\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc744 \uc990\uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uba85\uc18c\ub4e4\ub3c4 \ub3c4\ubcf4\ub85c \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4 \uac78\uc5b4\ub2e4\ub2d0 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uace0, 311\ubc88 \ubc84\uc2a4\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadfc\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc870\uae45\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uc18c\ub3c4 \uac00\uae4c\uc6e0\uace0 \ubdf0\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uc6b8\uae4c\ubd10 \uac71\uc815\ud588\ub294\ub370 \ud788\ud130 2\uac1c\uc640 \ub530\ub73b\ud55c \ubb3c\uc8fc\uba38\ub2c8\ub85c 7\uc6d4 \ucd08\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub2c8 \ub0a0\uc528\ub294 \ubc84\ud2f8\ub9cc \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 6\ubc15\ub3d9\uc548 \uc990\uac70\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\uace0 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\nI loved staying in Louisa's apartment and thoroughly recommend it for a taste of real Sydney life."}

Not much to do in the area. The beach is pretty far. Convenient location near the airport though. Only convenient store within walking distance is an IGA. Beautiful grounds and a very big complex.

Even though it was very hot for our stay, the accomodation stayed cool and the air conditioning worked well. Everything was very clean and tidy.\nSmall but modern and nice apartment, a bit far from the city  (1,5-2h by public transport), closest supermarket 15min by foot. Had an overall nice stay but a bit of a bumpy start with no electricity from the first evening until afternoon next day. Also, despite moskito nets everywhere, there were lots of ants in the kitchen and once a huge spider in the bathroom.\nWe enjoyed our stay. It was a very cozy little place. <br\/>as other have also mentioned, we had a little problem with ants inside, and we were also a little shocked that the door to the bathroom could not close fully.<br\/>one day, all the power went off, and we had a day without power. However, Bruce was so kind to pull an extension cord from the garage so that we had one outlet to use.<br\/>all in all a nice couple of weeks\nGreat place to venture out from or into Sydney, it's in a nice little neighborhood tucked away from the crazy traffic of the area and is in walking distance of plenty of stores. Bruce was a great host, when there was a problem with a fuse one night, he had an electrician in the very next morning and was quick in communicating at all times.\nMy stay was very enjoyable, Bruce is an excellent host, very helpful and generous, and the place gives you a lot of privacy. The driveway is steep but the area is beautiful for walks. Bus to Parramatta is a 5-minute walk away. Thank you!\nBruce was a great host, easy to communicate with and very quick to respond.

Feels like home, very comfortable space, will definitely come back near future for our next trip\nawesome overall\nThe place is as described and it\u2019s simple but super nice.

It\u2019s not their fault and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s nothing they can do about that but I think it\u2019s important to know before booking.\nEasy to find and very well located to either go downtown or to the beach.

Enjoyed our stay\nThe place was very lovely, very clean and easy to get to places very central\nVery modern and stylish. Simple, effective layout. Close to Central Station and the light rail (tram).\nMight've just been unlucky, but I had a few mishaps with this accommodation. Urban Rest did manage all the issues well and professionally though.<br\/>Heads up: they rent out multiple apartments in the building and the images you see do not necessarily match the apartment you'll be getting. I fell in love with the table and the chairs on the balcony (to work from in the sun!), only to find out my apartment doesn't have them.<br\/>Would say it's a decent, but forgettable place that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to others.\nGreat place, great location. Stunning, really. Highly recommend. I\u2019d say this is the coolest neighbourhood to stay in Sydney, and the coolest place I\u2019ve ever rented."}

{"listing_id":859206348848918958,"comments":"you couldn't ask for a better location as far as convenience to all that Newtown has to offer. you are right in the Center of everything but you don't hear any of the traffic noise from King Street. the place had really comfortable beds and was quite spacious. the only downside is it is directly under a flight path. I am not sure if this is a temporary problem but we found it quite noisy.\nUnfortunately the house smelled of sewage. We had booked for three nights, my family arrived late the first night. It was so bad in the kitchen and bathroom they couldn\u2019t eat in the house. The bedrooms were still smelly but less so. They had no where else to go the first night so stayed but moved out the next day. Host was very surprised at the issue, said it had \u2018perhaps just started when we arrived\u2019 what does that mean? He shortened the trip by one night and refunded one night. Wouldn\u2019t refund the first night so we are still out of pocket for that plus the Airbnb and cleaning fees - about $500 out of the $1000 paid. I\u2019ve escalated to Airbnb. We\u2019ve always had a great experience with Airbnb - hopefully this is a terrible once off.\nReally enjoyed our stay <br\/>Great location easy to get in and out of Sydney\nThis house is in a great location and would be ideal for a shorter stay where you are happy to eat out for most meals. The kitchen is not well set up for cooking or meals at home. No fly screens on the windows  & doors to be able to let some fresh air in at the time of our stay which  was a shame as it could get stuffy on hotter days.\nHouse is well located and the host is nice and responsive. <br\/>House is very basic in terms of amenities though and we highlighted some maintenance issues for them to fix.\nWas there for a concert at Enmore Theatre so location is excellent. Be mindful that you are on the flightpath so noise can be an issue, especially if planes are landing from the north. Good stay but didn't get the value for money I was expecting.\nCommunication with the host was great, very responsive and flexible. The place is very well located, just a short stroll to the train and shops. The house was fairly clean, but there was a strong sewage smell that came from underneath the kitchen sink.\nGreat location\nWell organised and comfortable place to stay at.\nThe positives: location, location, location! If you\u2019re looking for a place close to the station and some of Newtown\u2019s best cafes and bars, this ticks every box. Located on a quietish street away from the hustle and bustle of King St with not a lot of noise at night.<br\/>The negatives: not very cosy or well-equipped, although it\u2019s a new Airbnb listing so this may change over time. A few nice kitchen things or cooking basics would do wonders. The house is fairly draughty and in need of some TLC. If you are a tall person, you may struggle with the shower!<br\/>Overall, it was a good base for a short stay and communication was fine.\nThis home was perfectly located off a main street so quiet but so convenient to great restaurants and shops. It was easy walk or catch public transportation with several different options. The home was clean and comfortable for 4 people. Very much appreciated the full kitchen and having a combined washer\/dryer available. It can be loud when planes are flying overhead but that wouldn't stop us from returning. All the other conveniences were well worth it.  In winter come prepared for a chilly home on cold days.\nGreat spot right in the heart of Newtown. Nice little courtyard, decent kitchen, nice rooms"}

Highly recommend!\nToni was a lovely host, responsive and happy to help with any query I had. <br\/>The loft was cosy with beatuful styling, great sunlight, and the hosts had clearly thought of everything that their guests may need during their stay.  the location was perfectly nestled out of the main hub, meaning it felt private and peaceful. all while being a very short walk to the town\/ferry terminal making the city easily accessible! <br\/>Would definately reccomend and stay again!\nWonderful helpful hosts"}

Suzanna was an excellent host.\nThe flat was in a good location, no more than a 10 minute walk to get a ferry. We found it easy to enter using the lock box. What kept me up at night and will prevent me from returning to Suzanna\u2019s location was the urine smell in the bedroom. It penetrated all of my plastic containers for toiletries- I had to 100% throw them all away. I even threw away our travel neck pillows too. In addition, we needed to take time out of our vacation to wash everything. When Suzanna responded to our concerns, she said she put a deodorizer in our room\u2026 I appreciated that she responded, but the deodorizer did nothing for the heart of the situation. I hope this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else in the future.\n\uce68\uad6c\ub958 \uc138\ud0c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574\ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\nGreat host. Great location. Great stay."}

We had a wonderful and comfortable stay at her place. There were quite a number of stairs leading up to the house (which we already knew about) but the inclinator was very useful to transfer luggage and wasn\u2019t a hassle for us. The house was spotlessly clean and we loved her personalised welcome message for us. The kitchen and fridge were well stocked with goodies and exceeded our expectations! We loved the bowl of fruits and bonbons to welcome us!She definitely know how to go that extra mile to make her guests feel special. She was always responsive and got the sofa bed ready for us before we checked in.

We would definitely stay here again!\nWe were able to check in early which was so lovely! Unfortunately when we did arrive there was a lady in there but she was so lovely! We just felt awkward about it because we didn\u2019t want to interrupt. The streets around are busy and quite a few homeless people which first impression didn\u2019t make us feel very safe but the area is lovely and so many nice food places. The flat itself, it\u2019s really nice and had everything we needed for our weeks stay. The only downside is that our pillows smelt a bit funky so might be time to replace them. We would 100% come and stay again and thank you for having us. Also has everything you need to cook and the other tenants in the building aren\u2019t noisy you do feel privacy.

They did try to fix it and brought in antennas but it still didn\u2019t work.

The place is very spacious and has a beautiful character.\nThis place was really nice overall and our hosts downstairs were very welcoming. Felt quaint and well-loved, with lots of books and old records around, even some antique rocking horses for our toddler. The view from the balcony is wonderful! The apartment was well-stocked and very walkable, just a few minutes from Balmoral Beach and the shops and restaurants in Mosman. Unfortunately, it could also use some upgrades and maintenance. It was extremely dusty and, having bad allergies, I had to deep clean the rooms myself since we were staying for three weeks. There were dead roaches on the floor when we arrived even though the cleaner was just there (the service kindly allowed us to drop our stuff early). The apartment is on the top floor. So if you're travelling with a toddler or baby, the steep stairs are definitely a concern. We barricaded the top of the stairs with a heavy chair in the absence of a baby gate. Other than that, it suited our needs and we felt right at home.\nTo be honest, the cleaning fee is so high but it\u2019s not worth the stay. The place is still so dusty and we find stains on one of the pillows. Table cloth as well. One of the cupboard doors is broken. Quite a bit of fixing needs to be done. Fan and above the fridge are full of dust. Insufficient toilet paper, only 1 roll given for our whole 4 days stay isn\u2019t enough. Only 1 lights works in the master bedroom. Sofa is ready to get thrown out as you literally sink into the couch. Heater and hot water are fine in this cold winter. Please reconsider charging such a high cleaning fee or change your cleaner cause it\u2019s not done properly. There are stairs and quite tight.

It also made for the simplest airport to city transfer I\u2019ve ever had. <br\/>We will 100% return when we get back to Sydney.\n\uc219\uc18c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc740 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4<br\/>\uc13c\ud2b8\ub7f4\uc5ed \ubc14\ub85c \uc55e\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58<br\/>\uc5ed \uc55e\uc778 \ub9cc\ud07c \uae30\ucc28 \uc18c\uc74c\uc740 \uc7a0\ub4e4\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.<br\/>\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uadc0\ub9c8\uac1c\uac00 \uc900\ube44\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}

Ebenerdig gut erreichbar. W\u00fcrde wiederkommen.\nClean and tidy and spacious  but apart from microwave and kettle you couldn't eat there. Breakfast description confused me. There was cereal and small amount of milk if that counts  as a continental breakfasy .Cutlery etc but nowhere to wash it up  ?\nTidy and nicely set out bedsit near buses for Warriewood and Mona Vale.\nWe like Elizabeth's property because it's quiet and peaceful and a quick drive to the local Mall and shopping village. Close to the beaches and also the lake for swimming or fishing.\nElizabeth\u2019s place was lovely. It was very clean & spacious as well as private. <br\/>Elizabeth was very friendly & a great communicator, I would definitely recommend this place & would re book next time in the area.\nNice quiet neighborhood and lovely to wake up to the birdsong from the nature reserve across the street. Short walk to the bus stop. Room was nice and tidy. Would recommend.\nLovely room and bathroom with classy touches. Elizabeth was wonderful and very helpful. This is a great location for Sydney\u2019s northern beaches at an extremely reasonable rate. Quiet, stylish and perfect location. Thank you Elizabeth!\nAmazing! Comfy and clean. <br\/>Elizabeth was a friendly host. Recommended!\nLibby went above and beyond to ensure our stay was absolutely fabulous. As we were staying for a month we really did need a home from home and this was just great. We knew the area and that shops, restaurants etc were within easy reach without being in the middle of the younger crowd of beach lovers. Not being able walkers we had a hire car but the main bus route (B line) is also great and walking in the area is good for those that can. We have already told her that we intend to return in 2 years and are already looking forward to it. Hope this helps.\nCozy little stay, very clean as pictured, easy to access and in a nice secluded street. During my time I only needed somewhere to sleep for the few nights I was there and Libby\u2019s was perfect for that! Will definitely be booking again when I\u2019m looking to stay in the area.\nLibby's place was extremely well-presented and bright and clean. It has a wetlands area across the street, which adds to the peacefulness. Even if you don't have a car, it's only a 10 minute walk to the main transport route. The bathroom is very roomy and spotless and the shower is great. Great value for money and highly recommend for single or couples. Glenn.\nThis was the perfect place for a work engagement nearby. Two nights here didn't seem like work - it was like a little retreat. Thanks Libby for a great stay!\nPerfect stay for my business trip, as always.\nI enjoyed the place and the surrounding areas"}

Tuvimos problemas con el horario de ingreso por que se nos rompi\u00f3 el veh\u00edculo y serena estuvo dispuesta y colaborativa a solucionar la entrega de llaves. El departamento es muy amo lo y muy limpio. Exactamente como se describe. Es una zona muy tranquila, con algunos bares y restaurant cerca. Lo bueno es que hay tren, bus y tranv\u00eda a una cuadra. Hospedaje totalmente recomendable si su idea es visitar Sydney\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Serena\u2019s place. The hosts were very responsive and helpful when we needed it. The apartment is spotless, quite spacious and even had a pool! Instructions for check-in and how to navigate the way up the parking space were provided in details and in advance. We had to pick up our key from a different collection than initially described (for factors out of the hosts control) and they offered to reimburse us a fraction of our payment to accomodate the inconvenience, and they also allowed us to check out an hour late upon our request. There are lots of places to eat and drink a couple minute walk from the apartment which was great! Our only issue was difficulty picking up and dropping off our key which was a little inconvenient. Overall pretty good experience!\nIf you are after a safe , secure and clean Air bnb close to Westmead Hospital<br\/>this is the place i would highly recommend.\nEverything was great except for the beds.  Mattress in both rooms wasn\u2019t the best. Other than the bed situation very nice place to stay.\nAbsolutely loved my stay! The host was incredibly responsive and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. Check-in was seamless, and they provided great local recommendations. The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. I felt right at home and can\u2019t recommend this spot enough! Will definitely be back!\nwas very hard to pick the key up out of a lock box on a sushi restaurant door 3pm checkin was same time as school students arrived so found myself blocking the door instructions to use a back door were a red flag at first but found the position to the hospital to be great at which our stay was for. The beds were ok, pillows a little soft for my liking. There was a very strong smell of spices in the room almost overpowering the first time you walk in so we spent most of the time with doors and windows open. The off street parking was a blessing and the location to hospital shops, and the pub across the road for counter meals was fantastic would stay here again if required for an extended hospital stay again maybe bring my own pillows.\nWe were long stay tenants, eight weeks in this large, airy unit situated in Westmead near major hospital.  Close to both Parramatta and Merrylands shopping malls.  Very suitable with tons of storage, easy to keep clean.  Serena was always available to answer queries and very helpful.  We would give it five \u2b50\ufe0f\nnice place clean and tidy and owner was very responsive. would recommend others to stay here\nVery tidy & clean place. Very spacious. Great location for Westmead hospital.\nBeds were extremely hard.\nHad an incredible stay at an amazing location. The super nice apartment was very clean, and the owner was highly responsive. It had everything you could need for a comfortable and enjoyable family stay. Highly recommended!\nExcellent location walking distance to West Mead hospital, train station, bus stop and numerous food options. The apartment was comfortable and Serena was a great host.\nGreat location <br\/>beautiful apartment <br\/>Serena was super helpful\nNice place to stay <br\/>very clean great location"}

The house was spacious enough for our group of nine, but it\u2019s better suited for short stays rather than longer ones.<br\/>While the very basics were provided, there were a few missing essentials: not enough large plates, no teaspoons or water glasses, very few cooking pots, and only a single tea towel. The oven was useful, but there were no oven mitts. The washing machine and clothesline were handy, but there were no pegs to hang clothes. Some of the furniture, particularly the outdoor chairs, are showing wear\u2014so much so that we didn\u2019t feel comfortable using them.<br\/>That said, we enjoyed our time here and bought a few things that will hopefully make the next group stay a bit easier. With a few small improvements, this place could be even better!\nThe house is beautiful great location clean a quiet neighbourhood grateful family\nGreat location\nReally enjoyed our stay, very easy access and communication. Perfect location for our stay needs.\nThe place is good as it far from Sydney CBD. Perfect spot for family as Cole and other shops near by. <br\/>The only thing need to be improve is the <br\/>> master bedroom bathroom while taking the shower water is leaking from the door gap. <br\/>>The sofa needs to be removed from garage as it already broken it and occupying space. <br\/>>The big dinner plates need to be changed as it not fitting in the dishwasher. <br\/>>Please put small teaspoons also.<br\/>>The washing machine make to much noise. <br\/>>Please fix the garage door and also it not mention in the description as it broken from last two years. <br\/>Xian mentioned as she had a mounted AC in bedroom but we couldn\u2019t find any. <br\/>I still recommend to stay here if all these issues will be fixed as the house is perfect for two families as there Cole\u2019s to close and other restaurants. <br\/>Xian is very responsive and understands the situation well. <br\/>The check-in is very smooth as she explained how to get in the house.\nI have a few complaints as the description of the house does not match the house. <br\/>1. It\u2019s stated this is a new house, it is not new. <br\/>2. The mattress in the first bedroom on the right is broken and you can see that the wood underneath the mattress is broken.<br\/>3. We have paid and booked for 9 people. It\u2019s stated that there\u2019s a sofa bed, the sofa seat is broken, dirty and has rips. No sheets or pillows are provided to sleep on unsanitary sofa bed.<br\/>4 The iron and iron board is extremely dirty, we have had to buy our own. <br\/>5 The washing machine does not clean and it is unbearably loud, we cannot sit in the living room whilst it\u2019s on.<br\/>6 We received a noise complaint for being \u2018too loud\u2019 and \u2018having a party\u2019 when we were playing cricket in the backyard on a weekend and went back inside by 8pm. We were threatened with a fine without asking us what actually happened.\nHad a great stay with large family in the same house. Xian was responsive to messages and very friendly. Would love to visit again.\nThe house was good space for our family in a beautiful neighbourhood close to a number of major stores. Hosts were definitely responsive and as helpful as they could be, no communication issues on their end but unfortunately a few things that let us down. From the garage which was not operating when we arrived, which was one of the reasons why we wanted this place. Sofas in the house were super uncomfortable and we had to clean the crumbs\/rubbish that were in the gaps, considering there was no broom or dust pan, the vacuum was also not working, so we improvised with what was available. Felt like it was good stay if you were going in and out constantly. If you\u2019re looking for a home away from home, this would need some improvement indeed to be that. So much potential for a beautiful home though\nIt was a pleasure stay !\nClean and looks exactly same as depicted in pics, responsible and helpful host\nNice and clean house to stay. Comfortable for family of 6. Close to shops to amenities.\nGreat place and location\ngreat place,great location,clean,the host are super friendly and helpful\nNice house to stay when travelling with a larger group. Local shops with supermarket is nearby. Minor issue with neighbours having a domestic dispute but otherwise a quiet newly developed area.\namazing place will definitely be coming back"}

It was very very hot on the nights I stayed and but it was peak of summer so that is expected, the desk fan didn\u2019t offer much cooling.

When I was searching Airbnb for a place on or near Bondi Beach, this caught my eye. I wondered if the view could be as good as the photo. Well, it was and even better!

It\u2019s clear the host takes pride in maintaining the property.<br\/>That said, there were a few areas where the stay could be improved. For instance, the lock box would jam and inputting the code was difficult. There was a coffee pod machine supplied however, no coffee pods were supplied. <br\/>While these aspects didn\u2019t ruin the experience, addressing them would make the stay truly excellent. I\u2019d still recommend this property to anyone seeking a clean and comfortable place, especially for shorter stays!\nGreat location, comfortable beds and enough space to sleep 6! We were there during a heat wave so it was VERY hot without any AC, so I would just be mindful of that. We also had to pay per hour for early & late checkout, but they were able to accommodate that which was great.\nThe photos of this property were definitely not what we walked into. There was paint peeling off the walls, over grown weeds in court yard that we were unable to sit and use this area. There was a very stale smell throughout the whole property. We were quite disappointed.\nWe travelled to Sydney with international family and friends, and they loved staying here in Millers Point! The location was perfect and an easy walk to the Harbour Bridge or around to Darling Harbour. There were a lot of great pubs nearby and we rarely used the kitchen.

The place itself is very cozy and has everything that's needed for a stay of any duration.<br\/>The only downside is that it's right between Schofields station for trains or shopping and Tallawong Village for Metro and city connections and buses tend to be a little unreliable, which makes it a little inconvenient if you don't have a car. But that's something Don can't change, you just need to be aware of it or be willing to walk.<br\/>One thing that I either didn't find or was missing is a bigger pot for cooking pasta, since the available pots were a bit too small to make spaghetti\nNice little unit, family friendly.\nThe place is nice and tidy and easy to find.<br\/>The host provided detailed instructions for easy check-in.<br\/>We found a nice small welcome basket with juice and some chips inside.<br\/>We will definitely book again in the future.\nWe loved Don\u2019s Schofields apartment!

We will definately be back.\nHad a lovely comfortable stay at Amba\u2019s place! Great view of the harbour bridge and opera house. Would love to stay again next time I\u2019m in Sydney! Thanks Amba :)\nAmba\u2019s place is a small studio flat, it is well thought out and has space to hang a few clothes, a small kitchenette, a nice high table with stools to enjoy the stunning view of the city and the harbour bridge. It is stylish and comfortable. The bathroom is a touch dated and the sink needs repair. It is quite noisy but we expected that from the reviews. Double glazed windows would make the studio quieter. The surrounding area is very nice, handy to have a supermarket just opposite. Cheaper restaurants a bit further up the road. We had a car, during the week parking was very expensive at Kings Cross car park, it would be a good idea to check out cheaper options, if there are any. We picked up the key from another building not at the desk of the building the unit is in, which was a bit confusing especially as we\u2019re tired from a flight. Amba was easy to communicate, in all a very pleasant comfortable stay.\nAmba\u2019s place was absolutely perfect for my 8 night stay. Communication was great from pre-booking all of the way through. <br\/>It felt like home as soon as I walked through the door and I felt very comfortable the whole stay.<br\/>The views from the window are amazing and the location is very peaceful. It is in walking distance of the main sights and great transport links. Lots of great food options on the doorstep. <br\/>I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone and would love to return sometime.\nMy husband and I had a wonderful stay at Amba\u2019s place. The pictures in the listing are accurate! We had a perfect view of the NYE fireworks right without having to step outside! The location is great, accessible to many cafes, and provides for a less touristy feel.\nLoved my stay! Potts point is a perfect location and the view from the apartment is stunning. Everything as described the bed is so comfy and the apartment is immaculate I cannot wait to stay again. Thank you Amba \ud83d\ude42\nHad a lovely 4 night stay at Amba s place. It s in a great neighbourhood with lots of caf\u00e9s and eateries and cute little stores. It\u2019s also walking distance from the Opera House and other touristy places. She was super responsive. And answered all our queries quickly. Overall loved our stay!\nThis was a great stay!  It's hard to think of a better location in the area. Yes, you could stay a bit closer to the train station, but this spot is still and easy, quick, and safe walk down the street where it's peaceful and full of green trees. Plus Woolies is right across the street, not to mention so many good cafes and restaurants.<br\/>The apartment looked just like the photos, and also was very clean and tidy. Amba was great to communicate with, super responsive. All in all, a great stay especially for a single female visitor!\nAmba\u2019s place was absolutely perfect in every way. Not only are the views stunning, especially at night time, the apartment was spotless, modern and extremely comfortable to stay in. After travelling from the UK, we were relieved to have an easy check in and a great night\u2019s sleep. We did not find the area to be noisy at all and the apartment did not feel small to us. The apartment also included thoughtful finishing touches such as washing pods, linen spray and cleaning products. It felt like a home with easy transport links and a beautiful walk through the gardens to the CBD. Amba couldn\u2019t have been any more helpful and friendly. Thank you again, you made our visit to Australia even more memorable!\nWe had a fantastic stay at Amba\u2019s place in Potts Point. The apartment was in a great location, it was super comfortable and clean. Amba was an amazing, friendly host! Super helpful and very responsive. There was lots of restaurants and cafes around the area, walking distance. We caught Ubers when we went to the city and other areas, which was very convenient. However, we were so happy with the location and found it relatively quiet. We will definitely book again on our next trip to Sydney. Thank you for hosting us Amba.\nThe studio flat is in a lovely location and the view to the harbour is stunning and unimpeded. We had a bit of trouble with checkin where we couldn\u2019t collect the keys for 20 mins after a 30 hour journey because the doorman wasn\u2019t around, but this is not the fault of Amba. The location is close to a train station and about 15 minute walk to the botanical gardens and 30 to the cbd. Quite expensive for how far it was out and how small it is but did the job. Nicely styled inside and clean apart from a stain already there on the sheets. Looked like a dried makeup stain so we didn\u2019t report it as it wasn\u2019t a health hazard. Apart from that the apartment was clean. The flat is really quite loud, this is highlighted in the description but the sounds are not just street hustle and bustle or construction. There are ventilation holes in the windows which means sound comes in very easily and you may as well have the windows wide open.\nAmba\u2019s place was clean and had a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. My partner and I feel at home during our stay in Sydney.<br\/>The king-sized bed was incredibly comfortable, and I especially loved the selection of pillows, allowing me to pick my favorite for a good night\u2019s sleep :)<br\/>Amba was very helpful, she explained the check-in instruction very carefully so that we have no troubles, and helped when we needed a help. Thank you for a fantastic stay!"}

Jenny is super friendly and helpful - check in was smooth and easy. Even provided us with milk and orange juice. Didn\u2019t use the kitchen, (some of the dishes could use a wash).

No aircon but there\u2019s a fan.\nApartment desperately needs a renovation, particularly bathroom (falling ceiling tiles, gaps behind sink).

The kitchen and bathroom are great, and there was plenty of storage space to stow my stuff during my week\u2019s stay. Everything\u2019s in great condition, it\u2019s a nice bed and generally well equipped. Fantastic location\nThe room was lovely. But it was very hot and humid. The west-facing french doors meant that the room got the full force of the afternoon sun.  There were fans which we had to run all night. But it was still hot and humid. That's Sydney in summer. Air conditioning would have made all the difference. But the room itself was lovely, and the location was excellent. We'd stay there again, but not in summer.\nLovely clean apartment with all the essentials! Down a nice road 3 minute walk away from the Main Street of Glebe! Balcony was a nice touch :)\nThis Glebe property was surprisingly quiet and peaceful.  The local birds visited for a meal or two. The place has great access to shops and cafes.  We enjoyed walking in the local area and felt safe to do so. Thanks to our hosts for excellent hospitality.<br\/>Regards Pete and Jane\nBeautiful space, beautiful location, safe and secure, lovely little balcony. Clean, comfortable \ud83e\ude77\nThis property met our expectations but exceptionally warm weather hottest for 4 years made our stay uncomfortable. There is no air conditioning.\nWe would definitely stay again due to the fact it is next door to our son but unfortunately most of our visits are 1 or 2 nigts so it has never come up on my previous accommodation searches. Room was  very clean and suitable for our needs. Quiet well maintained facility despite it having 14 seperate short stay rooms.  Definitely recommend\nGreat stay, have used several times now, enjoyed having the extras for washing and making tea etc.  Very clean and location is right by bus stop.\nIt has been an amazing stay at Wigram 70. The room is very elegant with a seeet balcony where parrots come to visit and have breakfast with you. Lots of plus items as washing powder for the washing machine, bags of teas sufficient for a week stay, etc.\nIt\u2019s a good apartment in Glebe which is walkable to many nice areas. The apartment was neat, clean and well appointed. It\u2019s a studio but decent space to work and unwind. <br\/>Access is from the back of the building vs the front where you get dropped off via Uber. Check before you get out with your luggage\u2026 that was the only little inconvenience in an otherwise great stay.\nDecent place. Good location. But a little disappointed overall. I\u2019ll start with the bad stuff. <br\/>Firstly the internet was not usable on the first day which created issues with working from the apartment. <br\/>The shower leaked through the glass screen, which means floor is always wet (including around toilet). <br\/>Only two towels provided (a few more considering the shower situation would have been nice). <br\/>Some clearer directions on the lockboxes for keys not being at the designated apartment address (but rather, around the back lane) would have been nice (particularly as we arrived late at night). <br\/>Couple of bag stands would be appreciated, considering the tiny size of the place (otherwise, lounge and chairs used as bag stands). <br\/>Lastly, hosts were completely unresponsive to messages. <br\/>The good - good location in Glebe, nice historic style building, balcony (albeit, tiny) with afternoon sun (was nice in winter), and pretty quiet. <br\/>All in all, tad uncomfortable with all the issues.\nThis is the second time we've stayed at this spot. Great location near cafes and restaurants on Glebe Point Road and close to the city. It's a quiet building and comfortable space to recharge. We'd happily stay here again (and already have)!\nWe found the studio clean & well located to everything. The bed was very comfortable however the doona was just sandwiched between two flat sheets which was annoying for sleeping. The suite was well equipped and it\u2019s very handy having a washing machine and dryer for extended stays. Shower was nice and hot.\nGreat unit.\nclean and cozy"}

From the slippers, place mats, night movement light sensor to the TV that looked like a painting, everything was so considerately thought of and of very high quality. I enjoyed the coffee from the Nespresso machine in the morning. Even the iron board was from Joseph Joseph. The upstairs bedroom was fun for the teenagers. Lots of space to hang out.

Early morning coffee out on the balcony was a great way to start the day. <br\/>The salt water pool was amazing, it kept the kids entertained all day. <br\/>Jacqueline was friendly and easy to communicate with. <br\/>Thank you for a perfect stay!\nOverall, we had a nice stay at Jacqueline\u2019s place. The place is very nice, peaceful, relaxed and dog friendly which was great for us.<br\/>Using the showers meant both bathrooms got soaked as there\u2019s no shower door \/ glass \/ curtain to keep the floor dry. We\u2019d to then use multiple floor mats to soak it up and then they didn\u2019t dry.<br\/>The pool was fantastic, a really great feature. The cleaning pump didn\u2019t work so we\u2019d to pick out the leaves and bugs ourselves.<br\/>We were advised that the pool repair man would come to repair the pump but that didn\u2019t happen.<br\/>Having said all that, we would stay here again.\nBeautiful place, pleasant and peaceful with plenty of space for everyone.\nThis is a nice and clean, older style, home situated in a residential area with nice homes all around. There is a lovely pool and the outdoor areas overlook bushland, which is nice. There is an undercover outdoor space and also an open balcony. 4 bedrooms and 2 living spaces available for lounging.\nWe adored our stay at Jacqueline\u2019s place. Incredible surroundings nothing beats waking up to beautiful bushland and wildlife while still super close to the beach. <br\/>We felt super at home and comfortable and the pool is awesome! Very private location. Clean and comfy beds. Awesome place.\nWe had a great time at Jacqui\u2019s house! Jacqui went above and beyond to ensure we were well settled and were able to check in on time while booking at short notice. Highly recommend!\nOur family had a great stay. peaceful and close to the beach\nThe house was very comfortable and Jacqueline is a welcoming host - we really loved the personal touches of fruit and snacks on arrival. The beds are really comfy and there is plenty of room for a family to spread out. The pool is lovely and the house backs onto a reserve which makes it peaceful and private.\nA beautiful home with plenty of space for the family. Jacqueline\u2019s home was perfect for us to base ourselves near the northern beaches for 5 days. Easy to get where we needed to, and she was an attentive and proactive host, giving suggestions for eating out and activities in the area.\nWe had a great stay! House is really great and the kids loved the pool\nThanks for the opportunity to stay in the house and for your great communications. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\nall round v happy with this large house in lovely surroundings.......would be better still with A\/C but large fans worked well enough in the high 20's centigrade warmth.<br\/>kitchen was well equipped if a little tired (cupboards\/drawers) but loads of dining space\/sitting areas and bags of outside areas too<br\/>exactly what we wanted and loved every day !!\nWe  had the opportunity to stay at this lovely Airbnb. Overall, it was a pleasant place to stay. The facilities were well-maintained and thoughtfully designed. The decor was tasteful, creating a comfortable environment that felt like a home away from home.<br\/>One of the highlights was the variety of activities available. From board games to musical instruments, there was something for everyone. The swimming pool was a refreshing addition, especially on a how day. And let\u2019s not forget the great view \u2013 it truly added to the overall experience.<br\/>However, there were a couple of inconveniences. First, there was no parking available. This might be challenging for guests arriving by car. Additionally, the lack of disability access made it difficult for the grandparents to navigate the property comfortably. It would be wonderful if the hosts could address these accessibility issues in the future.<br\/>Despite these minor drawbacks, I would still highly recommend Jacqueline\u2019s place.\nJacqueline is the most wonderful and accommodating host. From booking to our stay she has been fantastic, quick to respond to any question and nothing was too much trouble. <br\/>The accommodation was fantastic.  We came with 2 children and 2 teens and we all loved the flowing space, fab pool and views into the bush. The mall and beaches are all really close so it\u2019s a great location too. <br\/>Highly recommend as a host and the accommodation and location are perfect for a beaches stay\nJacqueline\u2019s house was beautiful with amazing surroundings. We had a great time staying there."}

{"listing_id":929914779766194937,"comments":"Without using Airbnb for communication, host canceled first confirmed booking 2 weeks prior to arrival in Australia from east coast USA for daughter\u2019s wedding. Then proceeded to offer other listings to choose from without explaining cost or cost difference. Due to nature of the trip, we were under pressure to make a choice and went with the one recommended by host. With an additional $2000. to the amount already paid, we were able to secure another home in the same area. On arrival we were met with the cleaning crew still working and waited outside for 45 min. When others returned with groceries, the cleaners let us in while they finished. Perhaps they were rushed because we found underwear NOT belonging to our party in a basket and under beds. Stains on carpet, lack of toilet paper, and undisclosed cameras in the house. A Gorgeous location and beautiful home does not matter if it feels uncared for. Be aware it is centered in a VERY public, noisy and active neighborhood.\nA truly exceptional property. Plenty of space, fabulous interiors, absolute luxury. A perfect property for our family. 4 small children and six adults.

I didn\u2019t know there was a half bathroom until the last day.  Would have kept my pacing down!\nBathroom needs to be cleaned more often, and used toilet paper doesn\u2019t need to be constantly thrown alongside the toilet(I am sure there are toilet paper that easily dissolves and don\u2019t have to worry about clogging).<br\/>Water pressure is not stable with no standalone shower head, which makes it difficult to wash feet and stuff. <br\/>Overall, cannot ask for more for the price, but wouldn\u2019t come back until these problems are fixed.\nA smooth housing experience"}

Playground across the road. Nice area. Very clean apartment and quiet location. Bath plug does not work and multiple requests for issue to be resolved were ignored. Power to washing machine\/dryer was intermittent, not sure why. Wasn\u2019t resolved and had to use extension lead from TV. No house manual so everything we needed to know had to be asked for. Quite complicated with the pick up\/drop off of keys (restricted times not communicated ahead of time) and location of pool \u2014 had to ask for all of this. Host was accommodating of our extra guest and provided additional bedding. Lots of cupboard space for clothes. Air conditioning was great, with three separate zones. Good selection of cooking utensils and very comfortable overall.\nWe chose this property due to close proximity to the airport and for the facilities (pool\/sauna, parking, kids playground, Westfield shopping center next door) and it did not disappoint. We had a pleasant stay before returning back home. Extra thanks to the host who was very attentive during our stay. Would book again.\nGreat place great location...Thank you Ernest.\neverything lovely and clean.\nHighly satisfactory.  Place extremely clean. Only problem  bath couldn't be used due to outlet leaking all the water."}

{"listing_id":947455754043189061,"comments":"I had a mixed experience. The pros: lots of space (unusual to have a whole house), laundry facilities and in a really great location. It\u2019s on a quiet, leafy street with lots within walking distance. <br\/>The cons: excessive messages that were very robotic and a waiver to sign on charges for damages etc that felt hostile. The house smelt damp - it had been cleaned, but it doesn\u2019t feel well looked after beyond superficial details. The shower was broken, and bed was very uncomfortable for two people - one of us ended up sleeping on the sofa upstairs.\nCouldn\u2019t fault anything 10\/10 really enjoyed our stay and hope to do it again.\nGreat location in a walkable and quiet area.\nThe stay was great. Darlinghurst is a great location with many great restaurants and bars in the vicinity. Very close to CBD and many ways of transportation options. Would stay there again.\nVery beautiful cottage, very good location , you can walk to the CBD , Sydney s harbour, etc.\n\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\nGreat place to base yourself whilst in Sydney. An easy walk to restaurants, cafes, shops and Kings Cross Station. <br\/>House was tidy and had all necessary amenities to enjoy our 4 day break. Would use again\nLovely apartment in a great part of town.\nEnjoyed my stay.\nMy partner and I just moved to Sydney and stayed here for a few weeks while we looked for our own spot. The location is amazing and the house was very comfortable. Since we were staying for an extended period we really appreciated the space and it was nice to have the option to cook in the full kitchen and do laundry.\nI loved this house. It\u2019s in my old hood of Darlinghurst. Great house, great location and was perfect for just me.  Close to shops, great street with awesome cafes close by. House is really big and well looked after. <br\/>I will definitely stay here again.\nAffordable place to stay close to St Vincent\u2019s Hospital. Everything you need for an extended stay.\nMy stay was adequate.<br\/>I served the purpose and was in a very good location for me. Plenty of restaurants around and a short walk to Oxford street.<br\/>The house was clean however the previous guest rubbish was left there and I had to include in my itinerary putting the bins out which was rather inconvenient but I didn\u2019t want to pay extra fees. The place has an awkward layout but it was fine for one person. <br\/>The bed wasn\u2019t very comfortable and there\u2019s no aircon downstairs which I really would\u2019ve appreciated. I didn\u2019t necessarily think I got the value for what I paid but at the time I didn\u2019t have that many options. <br\/>It was fine, without any major issues but I probably wouldn\u2019t book it again.\nWonderful location and check-in was very easy. Downside was because of the layout of the house there wasn\u2019t really any central room to \u201crelax\u201d in - the couches were small. So after a day exploring we found ourselves laying in bed instead. Access to more amenities would be helpful too - tiny sample size provided for shampoo\/conditioner\/body wash.\nGood location, but didn\u2019t look exactly like the pictures and host was not very helpful. Overall nice stay but the experience could have been better."}

However, the best were extremely uncomfortable. In one room, it felt like a sheet thrown over a table.

Owner of the property was on the driveway one morning on the weekend to break up some furniture with a hammer. We left earlier than our stay..\noverall it was great experience to stay at Monte place. I will recommend this place to stay after long travelling. Because it was peaceful and easy to reach near shopping malls and restaurants. I will specially mention kind behaviour of hosts, as they allow us to check out one hour late than usual time. Pillows and blankets were more than enough. I will prefer to stay again if visited Sydney in future.\nGreat little house in an easy to access location!\nAbsolutely loved our stay. Monte had great communication, responded quickly.

For an extra comfy stay, I\u2019d recommend bringing ear plugs just because the patio restaurants can get loud in the evening but that\u2019s part of living in such a convenient location. Cheers Donna for a great stay!\nSuch a beautiful space to spend time in, and the best location to explore Potts point and Sydney! My partner and I had a long stay here for just over a month as we\u2019ve just moved over to Sydney and had everything we needed to make ourselves feel at home for this time. <br\/>Having amazing restaurants at the door step and being a couple min walk away from kings cross station made it so easy to get around. <br\/>Donna and Joe were super lovely and helpful hosts. Would highly recommend a stay here, the best Airbnb I\u2019ve stayed in by far!\n\uadfc\ucc98\uc5d0 \ube45 \ub9c8\ud2b8\uac00 3\uad70\ub370\ub098 \uc788\ub2e4<br\/>\uc88b\uc740 \uc704\uce58\uc640 \uba4b\uc9c4 \uc778\ud14c\ub9ac\uc5b4<br\/>\uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uc5b4\uba54\ub2c8\ud2f0 !  \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ub530\ub4ef\ud55c \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc990\uac70\uc6b4 \ud638\uc8fc \uc5ec\ud589\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\nDonna's apartment was great.

The communication with Donna was really easy, always here when needed and flexible w\/ checkin\/out hours.\nIncredible. The apartment was beautifully designed and furnished and in a very central location to hop around Sydney. I had a lovely week-long stay and highly recommend.

It is beautiful & very cleverly designed. <br\/>The location is great. Lots of good local restaurants & bars & walkable to botanic gardens & opera house. <br\/>We stayed with our 7 month old so weren\u2019t out & about too much in the evening. <br\/>Donna was a fantastic host, great recommendations & very accommodating. <br\/>Excellent all round.\nDonna\u2019s place is right in the centre of a great part of Potts Point. Apartment is very cool the way it has been refurbished. Fair deal of noise from surrounding apartments and restaurants but that was part of the charm. I could not find the toaster. Donna met me at the agreed time and showed me around the apartment which was very nice. I will stay again when next in town.\nWe had great time at Donna\u2019s place. <br\/>Very well located, walking distance to the best coffee, restaurant and transportations. <br\/>The flat was very clean, decorated with good taste and Donna even provided coffee, milk etc. <br\/>We highly recommend the place. As it is busy\/trendy area bring earplugs for the light sleepers.\nLoved my stay here. The apartment is even more spacious than pictures give credit. It\u2019s very clean and a lot of natural light makes it a very liveable space. All the amenities you need for a longer stay and close to plenty of amazing food\/drink locations. Easy to get to pretty much everywhere by either walking train or bus.\nLOVED this place and the hosts were so kind and responsive. Would 100% stay again. Thanks for having us!\nReally lovely spot in the heart of Potts Point. Donna and Joe were lovely hosts, and I would highly recommend!\nNice apartment, very central, nice people.<br\/>Approved! \ud83d\udc4d\nDonna is super attentive, a great host! gave me and my partner a list of things to do and always responds super quickly.<br\/>Her place is situated in the heart of Potts Point, close to everything you need. well equipped and very organised and clean.<br\/>It\u2019s also very tastefully decorated and has a great energy.<br\/>Me and my partner are very sad to leave but we hope to get back there one day!<br\/>Highly recommended\nLe logement de Donna \u00e9tait parfait, il correspondait aux photos et \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s propre.

Host was very proactive and detailed with their instructions, would definitely stay here again!\nThe place is in a perfect location if youre looking to spend time in Bondi. The place was also well kept and comfortable.\nLocation was absolutely ideal. Couldn\u2019t have been better. Loved it so much and Nick was a great host and very quick to reply. No AC was the only thing we found tough because of the weather but not much you can do about that. Would highly highly recommend.\nThe place itself was great. We did have some unforeseen changes we had to make to our booking and  Nick was understanding and did his best to accomodate and support which I really appreciated.\nWe had a wonderful stay at Nick\u2019s place! Would highly recommend to other friends\/family! Thanks for such an enjoyable stay!\nThis air bnb was perfectly located to allow my family and I to explore Sydney. Just a short walk from Bondi beach, bars and cafes as well as bus stops, we were never stuck for something to do. The apartment was spotless, comfortable and we had everything we needed for the 3 nights. The hosts were very prompt and helpful when we had any queries. Would highly recommend.\nWe had a lovely stay at Nicks place, great location and good communicator. Some minor issues but not a big deal - There was no milk for tea and there was a dirty towel in one room, but other that it was clean and tidy. Very comfortable stay\nGreat location - close to lots of restaurants, shops and the beach. It\u2019s a happening area at night so downside is that it is very loud. Unfortunately, it is a very tiny apartment so can feel too squished with 4 people and a little run down. Nick was a great host and was very responsive - kept up great comms right through till the end.\nThe home was beautiful and cozy. The location was great and very close to Bondi Beach. The host was extremely friendly and responsive. Prime location with good shops and restaurants around. Amenities in the kitchen and toilet was helpful, but a little more stock for a three day stay would have been great. Overall it was a good experience. Would recommend it if you are a looking for a stay in Sydney closer to the Bondi Beach.\nLocation is great, apartment is small but has all the basics. We had a couple of issues which  hosts attended to promptly. Apartment is good, lacks some small details but would recommend..\nThe apartment was immaculate and in a great location. The hosts were very eager to please and had lots of suggestions when we needed it. Highly recommended!\nOur stay was great, but I wanted to note that the apartment isn\u2019t soundproof so we found it extremely noisy at night, particularly on a Saturday night. I\u2019m not sure if this is normal for apartments in the area but all three guests experienced very disrupted sleep, from people on the street and surrounding area, very noisy traffic, and even wind. The building is quite old so requires a fair bit of maintenance, such as new windows, gaps filled etc. Otherwise, the hosts have done a great job of dressing the apartment, and the communication was good. The central location was also excellent.

The place is actually more spacious than we expected. <br\/>- We took public transportation during this trip and the bus stops were just right across the place.<br\/>I got nothing but good notes :)\nAmazing place in a great location.

The glass sliding door provide no privacy from the rest of the house. We were able to make it work however was a bit annoyed paying for what we were lead to believe was a 4 bedroom house and it not being that. Outside of this, the house is great, pretty clean and the location is great for anyone wanting a place to stay in Palm beach.\nAn absolutely beautiful stay! The house was well stocked, very comfortable, really clean. Perfect for our family to relax and enjoy. The pool got plenty of sunlight throughout the day, and the indoor-outdoor flow made it an ideal space to unwind. We loved having a barbecue and making the most of the stunning surroundings.

Amazing nature walks and bus routes nearby.<br\/>Great hosts, super helpful and communicative. <br\/>The kitchen was a bit bare bones, so not ideal for someone looking to cook much, but we had a lovely, peaceful stay nonetheless.\nOutstanding location, amenities and quality of accommodation.  A spacious yet cosy apartment that we felt home at right away. Sarah was a first-class host, responsive, friendly and happy to assist at all times.  Highly recommend Footbridge Cottage and will definitely be back.\nReally enjoyed my stay at Sarah\u2019s place. It was what the original Airbnb experience was pitched as. Spending time in a local community experiencing unique places. In this case, it was nature.\nThe pictures of Sarah\u2018s place absolutely do not do it justice. Beautiful shades of white and neutral abound. Open, airy, calm, peaceful space. Very relaxing and spacious. Everything we needed and our own outdoor space and garden as well as private entrance. I really felt grateful to share their home. She also had lovely breakfast food and beverages to get me started. As I arrived, Sarah was on her way to the grocery store and offered to take me and give me a quick view of the area. So helpful!\nThis was a gift for my niece and nephew who are bakers and needed to sleep in the day. Instead it was terrible noise from children running around above their head all day. Incessant thumping . The tree being chopped down next door was out of the owners control but the noise from being below their family is a big problem for anyone who is coming for a relaxing stay . Very disappointing <br\/>Maybe alright if you\u2019re planning to be out all day and only want peace when her children sleep. Probably a nice person kind communication but disgraceful noise in my opinion given that I made her aware that they would need to sleep in the day.\nWhat a great hidden gem. Beautiful location.<br\/>Sarah was a very prompt communicator.<br\/>The place was well laid out and comfortable.\nA lovely presented apartment in what can only be described as one the best most beautiful locations in the Northern Beaches.  Right on the Manly to Spit walk and 5 minutes to Manly on a bus.  If you are planning to stay in the Manly area then highly recommended.   A lovely host and family and was a real pleasure and joy to stay there.\nA good place to stay and feel close to the water! We had a great and relaxing time\nWe loved our stay, such a gorgeous location and we loved the apartment very comfortable, modern and very clean. Sarah was so helpful but very respectful of our privacy. Thank you for a wonderful stay we will be back.<br\/>Anne & Cubett\nLovely host, nice place, good for a weekend get away!\nBeautiful place, peaceful and relaxing. Thankyou to our host\nBeautiful stay, loved it. Sarah was a great host but still gave us our privacy. The area is amazing and very close to the harbour with a beautiful walk into Manly.<br\/>The bed is super comfortable and the unit tastefully decorated. Sarah provided lovely food and drink for us and I thoroughly recommend Sarah\u2019s property - we\u2019ll definitely return.\nBest Place to stay, would recommend it to anyone. Sarah is the best host. Cant wait to come back\nMy wife and I had the privilege of being Sarah\u2019s  first guests. It is private and comfortable in a very peaceful location right on the edge of the reserve and short stroll to the harbour in one of Sydney\u2019s most beautiful suburbs. I can highly recommend the Footbridge Cottage."}

There are so many good eateries within 10-15mins walk, and it\u2019s closed to Hyde park which means our toddler could roam free and explore safely. We also loved the extra things like Amazon prime and kiddy books which made our stay feel like home straight away. Thank you for being so accommodating!\nGreat location with parking, which is difficult to find. Balcony is a nice way to enjoy some fresh air with a good view. Some repairs were needed early in the morning which is understandable, I just wish it would have been communicated earlier than day of check-in.\nThis apartment is in a great location. So easy to get to and from the airport. Only a few stops and the station has lifts. No faffing around.  Also walkable to the central district but equally train and buses only a few steps away. <br\/>I think the apartment is actually better than the pictures. More homely. Had everything you need. It was nice to be able to go out on the balcony and listen to Sydney at night or check out the weather in the morning. Also the bed was comfortable and there is lots of space. <br\/>Presently the building is being renovated.

The layout matches the pictures. The parking spot requires opening the roller shutter, and the front bedroom is on the main road, surrounding area is convenient for shopping.

Host did a fantastic job. Just little pricey but overall fantastic experience with our stay\nIt is a lovely home and the location is perfect. Front bedroom is on the main road but there are two other rooms to choose from and the beds were very comfortable. The house was well facilitated with everything we needed.\nGreat place. The secure off street parking was one of the best parts. It made unpacking the car very easy. Old school charm with new renovation touches were great. Plenty of space. Great for a group of friends or a small family. Would recommend!\nThe house has a beautiful kitchen area and is perfectly located for easy access to surrounding areas. One bathroom a problem for 6 adults as well as only 1 bathmat. Stairs are very narrow and steep so difficult to take suitcases up. House was very clean and neat.\nAwesome location in Pyrmont, with cafe's at the corner, restaurants within 50m, both Woolies and Coles within a 2 minute stroll and the Fishmarket only down the road. The reason we chose this property was for the off-street and private parking which was awesome as our large SUV (2.1m high Toyota Landcruiser with rear cargo box) fit easily.<br\/>As others mentioned there was a strong musty smell in the house, either from the leaking fridge ice-box or other. Every room had air-con though, so the smell wasn't a persistent  issue.<br\/>The internal stairs are narrow and numerous, but that's what you get for this heritage-style property and we had no problems.<br\/>The house appears to be used almost exclusively as a short-stay, since all the amenities are the bare minimum, but everything is of a high standard. The beds are a bit firm, but the linen was well supplied.<br\/>Overall we'd recommend this to larger families looking for a close-to-city short-stay.\nThe property is renovated beautifully however a few noticeable things:<br\/>1. The two queen beds have extremely uncomfortable mattresses. Only the main bedroom mattress was comfortable.<br\/>2. The main bed had sheets that had a stain and undersheets kept coming off the bed and needed to be remade throughout the night<br\/>3. Place felt damp, needed to be aired a few times to remove the damp smell<br\/>4. Back windows would not lock leaving me feeling less than secure at night, with children in the house<br\/>5.difficult initially to locate the parking due to lack of instructions and roller door button tricky to operate, however we did get it to work.\nOur stay was beautiful, walking distance to everything and the house was newly renovated, have everything we need.  <br\/>The only comment was the front bedroom was a bit noisy at night when the car or truck drive passed."}
{"listing_id":998331545547318799,"comments":"Great location, beautiful views, clean, great level of communication.\nInterior designed \"penthouse\" isn't exactly the words I would use to describe apartment.  It requires a serious clean (particularly the outside balconies) plus a design upgrade to meet the expectation of rental tariff. By all accounts ..its a little tacky and looking very dated. The dead plants on outside balcony did not help with its appeal. The views are great...the location is central Alex was helpful. I doubt that this apartment would be on our \"go to\" listing in the future as there are many more on offer within Airbnb at a competitive price that offer both cleanliness,  bespoke design, layout, location  and amenities that far outweigh what the dollar value you receive than this one .\nWe were really happy with this location. Alex was super helpful from providing detailed instructions on how to get there to helping with  minor issues we encountered. The place was great. It was really convenient with access to public transport and good restaurants. It was spacious and clean and had a great balcony area\nAlex was responsive during the stay. The location is great, near the Crows Nest shops and metro.   However the place wasn't very clean (carpet, bathroom and floor was quite dirty). And there is some plumbing issues (sink doesn't drain very well) The tap of the bathtub fell off - I can see from other reviews that it happened before. we could still work without it so it was ok in the end. There are some photos on views from the apartment - the 'view from the bedroom' picture is quite different (further and maybe 30-45 degrees offset from what can actually be seen from the room - you will need to stick your head out pretty unsafely to see the same view), so if you are looking for bridge\/fireworks views look somewhere else...you can't see it as much as the photo. the view can only be seen from the neighbours in the same building. however, I do believe most will stay for location, which is exceptional.\nWe (family of 5) had a very good stay. Best parts:<br\/>- Superb views, in nearly all directions, from nearly every room<br\/>- Surprisingly spacious, considering the location. 5 of us did not feel cramped.<br\/>- Enormous balcony area, a substantial outside open space with amazing views<br\/>- Great location for restaurants and transport<br\/>The views & spaciousness are better than come across in the AirBnb listing, a pleasant surprise. <br\/>Niggles: <br\/>- The property is 'functional' rather than 'homely'. <br\/>- It can be a surprising mix of high-quality (e.g. crockery, cutlery) and oddly cheap (e.g; blankets, coat hangers).<br\/>- The amazing balcony area is spartan, bit of a missed opportunity.<br\/>These are small things; overall we had a very good stay.\napartment is in a great area near great restaurants and right across the street from the metro. apartment itself is comfortable and well kept.\nThanks Alex, great location, beautiful views and appreciate how responsive you were to our questions\/queries! Would stay again!\nGreat location, very convenient with the metro right next door. Very close to Crows Nest Village with plenty of night activity.\nAlex was incredibly responsive and super helpful. We got answers to our queries within the hour and for that we are so grateful. Additionally, the views from Alex\u2019s property were exceptional (especially at night).<br\/>The location is hard to beat. A stone\u2019s throw to the metro and an assortment of caf\u00e9s and restaurants within walking distance.<br\/>Our only critique of Alex\u2019s property was that it was a little worn and not cleaned as well as we would have liked when we checked in. The floors were not mopped and the toilet was not thoroughly cleaned in the en-suite. However, this is easily fixed. <br\/>Overall, it was a pleasant experience!\nA well kept apartment in a good location with an amazing balcony.\nAlex and his colleagues are very friendly. They always reply our messages quickly and help us solve problems. Metro is next to the apartment. The view is very nice \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nAlex was responsive during booking and checkin. The location is great, walkable distance to restaurants, metro, train station, parks and supermarkets. View is amazing. However, the place itself was not cleaned properly. There were some rubbish left in the wardrobe, floors weren\u2019t mop thoroughly, and cutlery in the kitchen wasn\u2019t cleaned properly. The  laundry door was broken, we had to screw some screws back onto the door. Also, the mixer of the bathtub was broken.

Such a gorgeous area, easy walk to Manly and beach right at the doorstep. Highly recommend!\nLove the area. So beautiful.\nGinas flat is lovely and the location is beautiful. Gina was also a great host, really welcoming and genuinely caring. Enjoyed my stay here.\nMy Son and I will remember our stay with Georgina for a very long time. She made us feel right at home and nothing was ever a problem. Looking forward to heading back to this beautiful airbnb in the near future.\nWie hatten eine wunderbare Zeit bei Georgina. Sie ist sehr herzlich und wir haben uns direkt wohl gef\u00fchlt. Das Zimmer ist sehr sch\u00f6n. Ich w\u00fcrde jederzeit wieder da \u00fcbernachten. Vielen Dank!\nGeorgina's apartment was amazing. It was gorgeous and spotless, with a stunning view from the terrace. The walk into town was a quick 15 minutes on a beach-view path. <br\/>In addition, Georgina was a lovely host, really friendly and kind. She also has an adorable puppy that made my stay even more joyful. <br\/>I would definitely return to her flat if I returned to Sydney!\nBeautiful apartment with outstanding view. Georgina was super friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again when visiting Sydney.\nFabulous location, great company and overall great energy. Couldn\u2019t recommend Gina\u2019s place enough.\nGeorgina's Airbnb is the best I've stayed on - and I've been to many! <br\/>The location is perfect, close to the beach in a calm area. The room is big and airy, and super clean! The bathroom is very fresh, clean and modern. Georgina is a lovely woman who's there to help if needed, I felt very welcomed by her. <br\/>I could not recommend this place enough, it's wonderful!\nAwesome place to stay and Georgina was so welcoming and a pleasure to stay with. Photos cannot do justice to the view. Highly recommend"}

There are plenty of great dining options nearby, including Chinese restaurants, steakhouses, and fried chicken shops, as well as a pharmacy and liquor store, all within walking distance. It\u2019s about a 15-minute walk to Burwood Train Station, providing quick access to the city centre.<br\/>The apartment is well-equipped, with ample bedding, kitchenware, and cleaning supplies. We cooked several meals during our stay and had a wonderful experience.<br\/>One thing to note is that occasional traffic noise can be heard at night from cars passing by the road in front of the apartment.<br\/>Overall, we had a fantastic time here and truly enjoyed our stay.\ngreat place, even the kids were calling it home. walking distance to buses, trains and plenty of shops. great communication and very helpful.\nOverall we were happy with our stay. The location is good and has easy access to public transport. It was great having two bathrooms. There is quite a bit of road noise being on a busy intersection so we were woken early each day.\nProximity to dining areas, shops and transport. Quiet location."}

Excellent communication from hosts. Would stay again for attending concerts in the future.\nThanks for the stay, Jeremy! Your apartment was exactly the right place for me to stay for attending the \"Everything Electric\" and \"Fully Charged\" Electric Vehicle show at the Sydney Showgrounds.<br\/>The apartment is large, spacious, well ventilated, and comfortable. It is also extremely quiet, and air conditioning, when needed, is extremely effective.<br\/>Thanks for making my stay so great. Pete.\nQuality space right near the park, great for trips out where a home base is required, with easy access to public and private transport. Jeremy was responsive and easy to talk with, readily solving any issues we found on our stay! Would recommend to others looking for an affordable place in the heart of sydney\nJeremy was helpful and a great communicator, but that's where it stops. The floor and glass doors was dirty. The bathroom floor was dirty and the showers had leftover hair and one of the drains was clogged. Even though someone was called to unblock, it only lasted overnight. The aircon turns off every night at 3am and we had to manually turn it back on and the control panel is outside in the lounge area. The sofa was dirty and stained and doesn't look like it was steam cleaned. The co-host said they only do deep cleaning once a month, and they refused to refund the cleaning fee and they offered to do the cleaning only after we queried about the cleaning portion of the fee for refund request, but we did all the cleaning upon check-in on day one. We are supposed to just check-in and chill and relax in this Airbnb, only need to do clean-up on check-out. The parking location is very confusing as there are no maps to advise where the spot is. Level 1 lifts cannot be activated properly.\nA good central location.\nthanks was a good place to stay\nlovely clean unit, great host communication. Pool is not heated, which was a bit disappointing as that was the main reason I picked this place.

VERY responsive, very proactive. She responds all days and times which I did not expect, but appreciated. The location was perfect, and accessible to so many sites. <br\/>Some of the comments we had as a group of 7 is that although this space \u201caccommodates\/sleeps\u201d 8 people there\u2019s no place to gather with that size of a group. You\u2019re limited to your bedrooms while inside the unit especially if you have someone using the couch as a fold out bed. There\u2019s some deferred maintenance in the units. Replacements of the very worn blankets, pillows, towels etc that are stained could be useful and appreciated by guests. Connecting to the internet for work or doing any sort of downloads was virtually impossible so we needed to go else where to conduct business so keep that in mind. <br\/>If you plan to be out most the day, and prepare small meals\/snacks since the kitchen is minimal this place will work great. I can\u2019t imagine trying to prepare a meal for 8\nFantastic location close to all the city attractions and a stones throw to the metro. Easy access from the airport.

The place was super cute, big ups to the shower head choice, couch and tv choice, and the above head fan in the bedroom. It should be noted that the coffee machine in the photos wasn\u2019t there for us (instant coffee provided satisfied the need) and the separation between the accomodation and occupants seemed temporary which meant steps and murmurs were heard (not too big of a concern for us, we live the same way\u2026lol) Regardless the place was super cute and well worth the price paid and the surrounding area had some very cute scenery.\nI often stay here 'cause I visit my family a lot.

The spacious area was much more than I expected, completely private with a lovely deck, living area, and separate bedroom. The outlook into a wonderful bushland with birds in abundance was so peaceful and relaxing, and I loved having a sundowner on the deck enjoying the tranquility. There was everything you needed on hand even down to umbrellas.

{"listing_id":1010527670165079777,"comments":"Not worth a full 5 stars, but definitely not worth 4 stars, I'd say 4.7. I enjoyed my stay for the basic, It was what I needed, a room for the night for work, good for the price, good location, decent street parking, bed was quite comfy and the room had more than I needed. I quite liked the room itself. Although only the one bathroom between 5\/6 rooms it was nice.<br\/>Just needed a few little extra things like at least a desk fan in the room as it was ridiculously warm inside the room, no AC, I had to hang out in the common space that only had a desk and chair and it was still quite warm. they did say they would get the cleaner to get me a fan the next morning but I was only staying one night so kinda pointless. and during the colder months I think it would be great (if not too cold)<br\/>leaving the kitchen\/dishes to the guests isn't ideal either as not everyone knows how to clean a dish properly, I just washed before I used, so it wasn't a huge problem at all, a dishwasher would be handy\ud83d\ude05\nOne star too many.<br\/>Quite possibly the worst Airbnb I've ever had. If they paid me back twice the amount of money I paid for the single night I endured there, I would still feel ripped off. <br\/>Please do not let the photos fool you. It looks quite nice and the price seems very fair and makes you think \"oh, it is 50 minutes by train from Sydney Central, that's probably why its so cheap\". Ehm, no.<br\/>The walls are not just thin, it's as if someone ducktaped pages of the bible together, hung it up and called it a wall. If you fell into it, you'd go straight through.<br\/>You can hear every tiny little sound, not just from your immediate neighbor, but from every resident in what I believe was 10 or so rooms. You'll be listening to farting, coughing and pens being dropped all night.<br\/>It smelled weird. The shared kitchen and bathroom was a nightmare. Which caused the other residents to leave doors and windows wide open. Didn't like that, there being poisonous animals and all.<br\/>Just stay somewhere else.\nThe place is not hard to find, train and bus stop were at the walking distance. There was hot water all day but no heaters and during winter it was pretty cold. The wall between the rooms are not actually wall they are made of wooden panel so there was it was no sound proof, I could hear my neighbours snoring at night!!! <br\/>The other guests were decent, not loud at all\nVery comfortable for my stay. Great to be able to walk to station (bit of a hill though!) and great location. Free parking on street was appreciated.\nMarvellous\nKen\u2019s place is a piece of heaven in earth. His place is extremely cozy, clean, and welcoming in all ways.  There\u2019s a really great sushi restaurant nearby the train station with good pricing and many other great restaurants nearby. Thanks Ken so much. One of the nicest airbnbs in Sydney \u263a\ufe0f\nExcellent value for money, peaceful location."}

The place is nice and clean but the private bathroom has a bit of mold, that said it was still pretty clean.

It did get noisy at night from cars and people outside but earplugs soon helped with this. The apartment is well located for easy walking into the city. The buses were also very easy to catch, with stops just around the corner from the apartment. Plenty of cafes & restaurants nearby, Thai one on the ground floor was great! We used nearby supermarkets & convenience stores. There was an adequate level of cleanliness throughout although small areas of the bathroom & kitchen could have been a bit cleaner. We had enough space for our family of 4. Kitchen well equipped, & appreciated the bathroom amenities.

Washing machine\/dryer was a great added bonus! Amazing host, super helpful and very responsive!\nDaniels place is centrally located right next to Hyde park with a great view. Walking to the Quay and opera house takes about 30 minutes, the Australia museum 5 minutes and many restaurants within 10 min. The pool, gym and hot tub are very nice although the hot tub was never very hot. It was just warm. The projector in the bedroom was fun to watch a movie on. Although there\u2019s lots of street noise, the bedroom has double pane windows and with the door to the living room closed it is quiet. The kitchen is setup okay for cooking. Parking is very convenient but costs $60 per day. You really don\u2019t need a car. The metro is a 5 min walk. Hyde park is beautiful!<br\/>Cons: All the windows and sliding glass doors were very dirty. There was a layer of dust over everything inside. The outside table was very dirty. There was a lot of dirt, dust and an old sock under the couch in plain view. The rugs and chairs are stained and worn out.\nDaniel was very easy to deal with. Helpful instructions. Always courteous and responsive. We enjoyed our stay."}

A very comfortable stay in Leichhardt\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel at home at this place. Paola ensured my stay was as comfortable as it can be. I enjoyed having my breakfast at her kitchen as the cat kept me company. Paola was lovely to chat with\u2014as an introvert, I barely say these words. 5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nI really enjoyed my stay in this house, very good experience! Paola is very friendly and provided me a lot of help.\ngood.\nI was looking for a clean place, somewhere to rest and recharge. Paola\u2019s place was a perfect fit, and I had a relaxing time.\nThat experience exceeded my expectations on different levels. First of all, Paola is a lovely host with such good energy. She made me feel home instantly.  Secondly, her place is very close to a busy bus route making commute easy. With that said it is also very quiet and safe area. The room and the bathroom is clean and the kitchen had all you need. If I have another trip to Sydney, Paola will be my first choice of hosts for sure. Thanks for all the goodness and care you provided Paola. :) All the best."}
{"listing_id":1023453179318189588,"comments":"We had a good stay at this property. The property itself was clean, especially the kitchen area. Overall, the property was a little tired. It was a bit dusty in hard to clean places and a few bits of hair etc but not problematic. Outside area is good and the local area is lovely. It is at the top of very steep hills, but there is a bus up from Manly wharf. You would struggle from Fairlight beach if not very mobile, but the beach itself was beautiful. Expensive for the standard, but that is just Manly in summer in general!\nChouette appartement, propre et bien \u00e9quip\u00e9\nGreat location and okay accommodation for 4 people. There were no basics (salt, oil, pepper) in the kitchen which was a disappointment and the place clearly has a damp issue as all our clothes smell of it. Just feels like it needs a bit more love and attention\n2nd stay in 2024 because of family needs. Wil stay next year because it is on ground floor with no stairs.  Walk to market, cafes. Walk everywhere and bus back.\nGreat location. Lots of great restaurants. We loved Fairlight Beach. Easy to use public transport.The Unit is as described.  I reported an issue regarding mould on the ceiling of Bedroom 2. There has been no resolution of this issue, which is disappointing.\nIdeally located, very clean with plenty of facilities. Thank you.\nFor most part, this apartment was as shown in the pictures and described. However what let it down for me was that I booked it specifically because it offers 2 bathrooms. We discovered the first night we were there that one of the showers was clogged and was unusable. I logged a request for repairs the next morning but repairs were not carried out during our stay. So basically we were not able to use the 2nd bathroom. That said, I've since contacted the agent who agreed to a partial refund.<br\/>I stayed in the 2nd bedroom, which sadly was in need a paint job on the ceiling and the walls. There were a lot of brown\/water stains. I've logged this with the agent. <br\/>The rest of the apartment was in good condition, with attractive and comfortable furnishings. The instructions for access was clear.\nGreat location, perfect for what we were looking for. Unsure why they don\u2019t have any options for heating. Would stay here again.\nGreat location for my needs in Fairlight and could leave my car in the garage.  The steep hill up from Manly needs to be negotiated if walking but can catch the bus for $1.00. The apartment was definitely light and bright.  Would have loved to have heating for my stay in July.  I was disappointed there were no basics in the kitchen for cooking. For example, every other AirBnB I've stayed in have had cooking oil, salt and pepper plus an assortment of seasonings left by previous guests.  I would, however, stay again.\nGood location to shops, restaurants and entertainment. Able to walk with a pram although there is a bog but manageable hill. Felt cold as no heating. As we stayed during a cold snap in winter we purchased some blankets and a small heater. These could be good additions for cold weather. Place was spacious. Great to have access to a garage to park our car. Quiet area and no noises overnight.\nGreat location with light and bright rooms. It was very cold when we stayed , would have good to have some heating. Thanks Trisha\nThis is a very nicely appointed apartment, with a lovely outlook onto the harbour, in a peaceful location, close to good shops and caf\u00e9s: I would be very happy to stay there again, and I recommend it without hesitation.\nOverall very good.  However, we were not told that the walk from the ferry to the accommodation was up a long,  steep hill. Not fun with cases in 30\u00b0+ heat.  It would have helped to be told there is a bus service (144). Also the directions in the app took us down the wrong driveway and we had to scramble through bushes, with cases, to the correct property, startling a young couple with a baby.\nGreat apartment in a great location! Thank you\ud83e\udd70\nKristine and her team presented a wonderful property for our stay. they communicated promptly and were always offering to make our stay better. We will come back next time we are in town!"}

It is as described being a studio type room with everything you need to stay and cook for yourself. Works for somewhere to stay but not necessarily to hangout, as there is no lounging space. This worked great for what we needed, whilst attending rental prospects in the area.\nGood\nI wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and share my wonderful experience at your Airbnb property. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the cleanliness and attention to detail throughout the space. I also greatly appreciated your responsiveness and willingness to help with any questions or concerns I had. Your hospitality truly made a difference and contributed to a memorable trip.<br\/>Overall, I had an exceptional experience and would highly recommend your property to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Thank you once again for being such a fantastic host.\nhost did not fix anything like the WiFi, hot water doesn't work properly, small area,\nSolid stay. No thrills spot in the location I needed. Very small as advertised, but with a comfortable bed, full kitchen & laundry. <br\/>No functioning wifi during my trip & a less-than-clean bathroom & kitchen keeps this place from getting higher marks.\nIt was totally ok, but the price for such small studio was high! Shower head was broken and the water was getting cold again and again while taking shower. Also, there are about 12 stairs at entrance, it would be better to install a small door there, as one may fall down, because the studio is very small."}
{"listing_id":1024292380115309666,"comments":"Great place to stay, James was a wonderful host who was very responsive and helpful! <br\/>Stunning interior and lighting in the house\nThis place was lovely in the photos. however we found fans didn't work, one broken bed which appeared to have bed bugs. one shower didn't work which was frustrating given the numbers, bbq was dangerous with flames coming out the controls. We reported issues but response was very PC and nothing done. Wouldn't have minded if it wasn't oversold online, as \"luxurious\". The renovation would have been nice but so roughly done and the white sofas all had terrible stains on them. Needs a lot issues addressing so check before you book.\nBeautiful accomodation! Very responsive host! Would stay here again!\nComfortable family home with pool in great proximity to shops and beach\nThis is a beautiful house. Stayed here over the nights of my wedding. It photographed beautifully as well as being a fabulous house for my group. We loved it. <br\/>There are several things that could be done to improve the stay, though. For example, the house accommodates 8 people but there are only 3 champagne glasses and there was no baking paper so we couldn\u2019t use the oven or have a drink together. We went to the local shops to purchase baking paper and additional champagne glasses.  Additionally, there were no bins in any of the bathrooms. Having these expected amenities available would go a long way to making the property great for guests\nLovely place would recommend this a good family gateway\nFantastic pool (probably the best private pool we have had) and a great property for large groups :) James was very accommodating and responsive. Would recommend. Thank you for having us :)\nIncredible stay, beautiful property & would recommend to anyone in town!\nGreat property and pool was lovely. Definitely recommend\nWe had a lovely stay in this house.  There were 9 of us all up, good size kitchen to accommodate all of us. <br\/>Pool and outdoor area was definitely a highlight for us. <br\/>A couple of suggestions, bring an eye mask, as many of the windows do not have curtains, or they're linen and don't block sunlight, and so the early morning light is sure to get you. <br\/>Locate the bug spray immediately.  The sandstone walls and floors have not been sealed so there were many cockroaches at night. As such, we weren't able to sleep in the ground floor bedroom, the trundle situated on the floor would have left us exposed to the insects.  Keep that in mind if there are many of you and you'll be utilising each bedroom. We ended up sleeping in the level 2  living room instead where there were no roaches. <br\/>I wouldn't let this deter you from booking however. <br\/>James, the host, was very responsive. Great cafe in walking distance too.\nThe house is beautiful and looks just like the photos. Great location. Previous reviews have mentioned concerns of privacy from the bathroom window, this has now been addressed as a blind has been installed. Do make sure you take an eye mask to wear at night as the curtains for many of the bedroom windows are linen, which look fabulous however don\u2019t keep the light out. I\u2019d definitely return to the house, we had a great weekend stay.\nThis place is beautiful and loved staying here. The styling is stunning and my friends and I all had a nice time while we were there. <br\/>James was also a pleasure to speak with throughout our stay. All of the instructions were easy to understand which made everything easy. <br\/>I would love to stay here again\nBeautiful home and everything the description suggested plus more. Brilliant!\nEnjoyed the stay, it was a seamless check in process, the main bedroom mattress was like sleeping on Air, enjoyed the stay immensely!\nHighly recommend, house was clean and tidy, good location, and pool was awesome. And James was a helpful friendly host.<br\/>Would stay again."}

The place was basic but comfortable and a great position for sightseeing.\nAziz was quite responsive and arranged check in before time.

Other long-term tenants who live there were friendly and quiet, so the place just so peaceful and perfect for your stays. Also, Tracy was very proactive and responsive, when we confirmed about facilities, he even gave us additional things we may need and allowed to put our luggage first before check-in time. He gave us local recommendations and things which is very helpful for first timer. It's located within walking distance hypermarket and to train station, and even better the bus stops to downtown literally just steps away from the property. Stay in Tracy's place is more than perfect and indeed value for money. I'll be back to Tracy's place when I visit Sydney again.\nTracy is really wonderful host I met, She and her husband  keeps the house extremely clean, all kind of the daily uses are provided, it mostly like to stay at my own place.

Good sized kitchen.\nThe apartment is really convenient for either walking into central Sydney, or getting trains from local stations. It is on the second floor, so you can just see half of the Sydney harbor Bridge, which was great as we could sit and watch the New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks from the balcony.

{"listing_id":1048436792461956984,"comments":"Luping and her husband Li have treated me in a very friendly and nice way, and they made me feel at home and even with a new family in Sydney. Often, Li brought me fruits, and the first evening Luping gave me dinner, which was great after such a long trip and having arrived late to the house. Eventually, we even went out together, and they invited me to have dinner, they have a great conversation. As for the room, I have no complaints, there was everything I needed and if anything did not work well, they came quickly to check it and, in case of need, replace it. Luping and Li made my stay in Sydney a great experience, I couldn't recommend them more! Now, I know I have friends in Sydney.\nWe had a lovely short stay, that allowed us to bring our dog along for the trip. This place had everything we needed and was well equipped to be a self- contained space.\nStayed here for 2 weeks and it was perfect! Big shopping centre a short walk away with everything you could possibly need and good transportation to the city and beaches! The hosts were very friendly and helpful and the room had everything we needed! Would definitely come back :)\nPlace was very great .\nPerfect for what I needed to do...sorting through my possessions after recently moving out of house. The large room area helped. Had never been to the area before but easily accessible by train and car. Street parking was generally ok to find a space.

Would definitely recommend!\nWas very comfortable and host was very obliging and helpful\nMyself and my partner stayed here for 2 months it\u2019s a great location and the hosts were very welcoming great for a short term or long term stay\nGreat communication & understanding from Luping. Good value for money for place on a budget. Slightly noisy due to main road but that meant close to shops. Only criticism would be the bed is very firm - pillows are memory foam and great but feedback to Luping - I would recommend at least a mattress topper for the bed\nThank you for your kindness and hospitality \ud83d\ude4f\nOur stay was great.

For the most part, it was well-furnished and had what we needed (eg laundry, linens, basic cooking equipment) for our stay.<br\/>Some points for improvement:<br\/>1.

Access was so handy, no keys to lose. Darling Harbour, the city and Circular Quay were all within walking distance so getting any type of public transport was really easy. The property was beautifully clean, beds were comfy, kitchen was well appointed and it was great having access to a washing machine. Sofa bed and foldout bed were accessible, if required.

We would absolutely come here again! :)\nBooked for my brother and sister-in-law who visited from the UK - FANTASTIC - highly recommend.\nLovely welcoming host and immature apartment.

Thank you so much!\nPerfectly located and suited our needs well. A short walk to the light rail and to the local eateries and close to family. We were 2 couples sharing the space so it was great to have a bathroom each."}

As a family of 6 being able to spread over the floors was very novel, a bedroom and bathroom on 3 of the floors was great for some separation for parents, and the kids loved it. A very nice kitchen leading into the dining and tv area, and the top floor being rooftop with outdoor dining and a bbq was excellent. This place is so conveniently located for easy access to walk to Darling Harbour, the National Maritime Museum, Sydney Aquarium, The Harbour Bridge, the city, Chinatown, Circular Quay and the Opera House and to catch a ferry to wherever else you may like to go. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Lisa's place.\nGreat\nWas in a great location and was easy to access. Had ample amount of space and was quiet and private. Was very happy with the hosts correspondence. Would definitely stay again\ngreat place and host\nThe place was beautiful and the host was very helpful.\nThe stay was great and was well-described. But some problems during our stay occurred like Wifi problem so we couldn't access Netflix or Youtube in TV, the living room aircon was locked so we could not change the heat temperature. Beside all of that, everything was really great. Communication skill was awesome and on time. Would comeback!\nthe house was great good location. lift did have a mind of its own. Great value.\n\u51fa\u884c\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u5165\u4f4f\u8212\u9002\nThe house was a very comfortable stay for 6 guests over the weekend. It was convenient for each bedroom level to have its own bathroom as this made things easier when getting ready, etc. The private elevator was a nice touch if you don't like walking up the stairs, since it is a 6 level building. We couldn't experience the rooftop area due to the rainy weather but it also looked comfortable as well :)<br\/>Very clean, location was great, easy walkable distance to supermarkets and cafes. The host had great communication, we had trouble with the lock passcode and they immediately responded and resolved the issue within minutes! Only issue was that the ground floor bathroom was having draining issues in the shower, other than that I highly recommend this place!"}

The location is so unique and beautiful, offering both tranquility and plenty of activities for the kids, including swimming, walking, and fishing. The place was very clean, comfortable, and is easily accessible by ferry.  And Amelia was a perfect host, going above and beyond. Thank you so much and we hope to visit again soon!\nOur stay at Amelia's place was fabulous. Her home is beautiful and the location is incredible - the photos do not do it justice! Amelia was really helpful and left us some delicious welcome treats which we all thoroughly enjoyed. The place is stylish and very clean. Her kitchen is actually better stocked than my own with everything you need (and more). The location is idyllic and there is lots to do - kayaking, paddleboarding, swimming, fishing or just relaxing on the wonderful verandah with a book. It was so peaceful that my whole family had a daily afternoon nap. <br\/>We booked a water taxi to get us there which was very easy. Mick met us at the Palm Beach wharf and within minutes we were climbing onto the jetty at Coasters. The public ferry was very easy to catch to take us back to Palm Beach again after our stay. <br\/>Thank you so much for hosting us Amelia. We had the best time and hope to be back soon.\nWe loved our stay at Amelia\u2019s beautiful coastal cottage! It exceeded our expectations with the most incredible location, access to nature and many thoughtful touches. Amelia is a very generous, friendly and responsive host. Highly recommend.\nWhat a lovely spot! <br\/>Unfortunately there\u2019s a construction site next door where the tradies blasted music from 7:30am-3pm 2\/3 days of our stay.  Not the serene vibe I was booking for. <br\/>The pantry is well stocked with condiments.\nWe absolutely loved staying at Amelia\u2019s. A lovely house and a magical spot, right next to the water with spectacular views. Amelia was a thoughtful and generous host, even helping us borrow kayaks. We didn\u2019t want to leave. Thanks Amelia!\nWe had an amazing time thank you Amelia!\nBlack cockatoos, wallabies and crystal clear water - Coasters is just delightful. Amelia was a brilliant host from the moment she made contact: responsive, helpful and super friendly. The renovated cottage itself is gorgeous too, with note-perfect decor and lovely amenities. I really can't say enough great things about this stay! Highly recommended."}

VB was always ready to answer any questions we had quickly to ensure our stay was perfect. The views from the bedroom were great at night and it was central to everything, including a huge range of eating options and the best coffee I have had conveniently located at rhe bottom of the building. Overall, it was a great stay.\nThe place was really well located with lots of local conveniences near by. it was easy to access the city and entry way, although we weren't able to use the pool as the key doesn't work on the door lock. we also found it to be quite noisy on the 18th floor as the windows didn't seal fully, resulting in alot of noise from the wind during our stay. <br\/>overall the apartment itself is nice, well provisioned with everything you need for a stay in the city. the bathroom was modern with a very nice Japanese style toilet and the beds were comfy. Vb was very informative with her communications to us and was quick to respond to any queries.\nApartment is in a great location, we had a lovely weekend away. Once the key was finally located as it is in a rather unusual location for the key, the entrance to the apartment was easy to find. The apartment itself is lovely and perfect for a short city getaway, located so very close to all of harbourside dining, chinatown etc. Pool is lovely! Could use some extra towels for the pool though. <br\/>5pm check in was a little difficult to manage with dinner reservations, would prefer usual check in time of 2\/3pm. Late check out of 12pm not entirely necessary. <br\/>Air-conditioner worked well, especially in the humidity that we experienced over the weekend stay. Place was tidy, clean and well located.\nVery convenient location in the centre of China town. Nice apartment with great views from the 18th floor. Swimming pool on the 6th floor was enjoyable. Pleasant base to go around seeing the sights. <br\/>Slight hitch at the beginning locating the key box from the tree guard in the middle of run down, smelly alley. Was unable to keep luggage earlier than the check-in time of 5 pm (!), but had Bounce luggage storage (convenience store) nearby which was cheap and effective\u2026\nCheckin time was listed as 5 pm<br\/>We requested to drop a small backpack  before heading to city for fireworks  on NYE<br\/>Request was not accommodated <br\/>Checking details were sent at 6:15 pm<br\/>Has to look for a pad lock in a lane at 1 am which was a bit inconvenient with two kids<br\/>This was not specified in the listing details<br\/>VB was helpful by giving us an extra hour to checkout at 11 am instead of 10 am\n\u6089\u5c3cCity \u5468\u8fb9\u666f\u70b9\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b65\u884c\u81f3\u3002\u697c\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u5403\u4e862\u987f\u7ca4\u83dc\u90fd\u4e0d\u9519\ud83d\udc4d\nGreat unit .

Apartment is well equipped, great kitchen facilities, not that we made use of them as we were out most of the time. Very responsive host and clear instructions of check in. Well worth the money and will definitely stay again if given the chance.\nThe place was ok but felt dusty and not fully clean, bathroom wasn't the cleanest.\nGreat location, very convenient and the apartment was beautiful and clean. Chauman was helpful and accommodated us on our check in requests. Highly recommend.\nRight in china town! Lots of great food places to pick from and 15 minutes walk to sea life aquarium. Great location\nRoom was really nice. Top floor and beautiful decor. Only downside was location right in the middle of china town the streets are quite dirty and smell bad\nChauman's apartment was well located for what we wanted to do in Sydney. The apartment was well appointed and comfortable, beds were comfy, bathroom roomy and far better than staying in a motel, I would certainly stay there again when in Sydney."}

The house is perfect if you want to explore the city! If you want to spend time inside the common areas are small but that wasn\u2019t an issue for us and I would definitely stay here again!"}
{"listing_id":1082142068139339396,"comments":"Lovely inside, with tasteful furnishings and decor. Easy to get to the city, lovely parks nearby, and great restaurants a walk away. <br\/>Bathroom could do with an update, but clean and works well. Air conditioning is only in the main living area. Only fans in the bedrooms.\nThe apartment on Morden Street was quiet, with spacious bedrooms and excellent parking. However, there were several drawbacks. There was no antenna to connect to live TV channels like 10, 9, 7, and ABC. Instead, you will need to subscribe to all apps on the smart TV, which makes it essentially useless. Additionally, customer service was frustrating\u2014calls are routed to a Filipino call center that doesn\u2019t connect you to a local Sydney manager, making it difficult to resolve any issues effectively. It was a decent stay, but these inconveniences were notable.\nEnjoyed the stay at the apartment. Good location North from the city with easy access to the CBD. Would recommend\nThe house was in a fantastic location and overall was clean, tidy, and nicely decorated. We enjoyed our time there; however, since the property was managed by a third-party service, resolving issues was challenging when they arose.<br\/>The first problem occurred when we didn\u2019t receive the check-in instructions. After spending some time on the phone, they eventually sent them to me. Upon arriving, we found that our designated parking spot was occupied by another car. Unfortunately, they were unable to resolve this, and the car remained there for the duration of our stay. Additionally, we needed an iron for a wedding, which was listed as an amenity but wasn\u2019t in the property. To address this, we were instructed to buy an iron ourselves and submit a receipt for reimbursement.<br\/>Overall, our stay was marred by these small issues, which detracted from what could have been a more enjoyable experience.\nWe enjoyed the location of the property. It was very spacious and looked like the photos. The beds were comfortable and the bedrooms tidy. The host was very responsive. After paying, I had to read and sign an extremely long list of terms and conditions and send my ID, I was not aware of this beforehand and this isn\u2019t usual practice on AirBnb. It was a shame that the hot water was not working properly. Although the host was able to instruct us how to fix this, it kept turning off mid shower. There was also some mould on the bathroom ceiling. The allocated parking space was taken for our entire stay. Overall, despite these inconveniences, we enjoyed our stay.\nMuy acogedor, tranquilo y en buena zona\nComfortable stay in a great location.  Overall the place was clean and well laid out with comfortable beds.  The bath seemed like it had some sort of permanent stain that we didn't want our kids to use.  There was good communication\nGreat location, close to the shops and market but in a very quiet road. Very comfortable beds. Thanks\nOur stay was great\nHad a great stay. Perfect to walk to local cafes or Harris farm for groceries. Great access to buses or easy drive onto freeway. Very quiet apartment block.  The allocated parking space was taken unfortunately but there is plenty of on street free parking. Beds were comfortable and we found it all very relaxing.\nThe Urban Serenity was a perfect place for two working colleges to stay.<br\/>Was a great place to relax and had a modern feel .<br\/>Easy walking distance to Harris Farm Market and some very nice Restaurants.<br\/>Highly recommended.\nLovely area, lovely host, clean and spacious, a lot of activities available locally would recommend\nGreat location in a nice quiet area. The unit is kept in immaculate condition and is comfortable and quiet. The car spot was very useful (despite being a little tight). Some points to improve the stay:<br\/>- add an iron and ironing board <br\/>- fix the shower head. It fell down a few times and even hit my son on the head<br\/>Despite this,  a great place to stay and we would stay again.\nGreat space and location highly recommend"}

Strongly recommended for anyone thinking about booking, just do it. <br\/>Thanks, Nobuko really appreciate your assistance as well.\nWe had a pleasant stay at The Lotus room.

We definitely felt the owner put a lot of effort in to make the place comfortable and clean.

Easy walk to local cafe's and the beach.<br\/>Quick drive to the shops and relatively close to main attractions, although I drove I noticed buses running constantly. <br\/>I found the bed very comfortable with beautiful clean linen, bathroom and kitchen well equipped. <br\/>I would not hesitate recommending this apartment for your stay, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely come back.<br\/>Lucine and Gareth are terrific hosts.\nPerfect place to stay in Balmoral - steps from the beach, lovely apartment with plenty of space.\nWonderful place to stay when visiting Sydney.\nLovely place close to Balmoral Beach and Mosman town centre. Luciene was a lovely and communicative host, and the place was cosy and well presented. It was perfect for a few days stay in Northern Beaches. Mosman is also a beautiful area, if kid safe beaches and all the shops you need within walking distance. <br\/>Only thing to note, is there hills and stairs to get to both the town centre and on your way back from the beach - so be mindful with small children or if you are not very mobile before booking.\nEtt drapei mella rummen saknas!\nWe stayed at Lucine's place for 3 nights over New Year's, in between our travels around Australia from the United States.  We watched the NYE fireworks from Bradley's Head Masthead and it was very walkable (as public transportation after the fireworks is hard to get), just over 2 miles.  Public transportation was wonderful from the apartment as well.  Lots of steps, but we were okay with that.  The location down to Balmoral Beach and up to the Mosman strip is fantastic!  Lucine was very helpful with answering questions and even provided much needed ice in a pinch.  <br\/>The space was large enough for our family of 3 - and could even accommodate another.  The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed some meals on the patio, too!  The unit did get warm in the heat of summer, but the fans helped cool it down a bit.  Definitely recommend for anyone traveling to this area.\nAmazing location- so close to everything that Mosman has to offer. Lovely place which worked well for a short stay for my wife, young daughter and I. Would definitely recommend.\nAn absolutely stunning apartment in a beautiful quiet location yet still only 5 minutes walk to the beach.  I\u2019d highly recommend this apartment to anyone after a restorative and peaceful base to explore from. We had such a lovely time and look forward to returning in the future,  highly recommend.\nAmazing home! Thank you so much Lucine for being such a great host. We will definitely be back!\nStylish, cosy and comfortable apartment just minutes walk from the beach and restaurants. Would definitely recommend.\nLovely location on a quiet street, very close to Balmoral Beach\nWe stayed at Lucine\u2019s place as a base for our wedding and it was the perfect location. They were very responsive for requests and were all too happy to help. Would recommend for anyone looking to stay in the Mosman area\nMy daughter and I booked this airbnb for our stay in Sydney and were not disappointed! From the moment we booked our stay, the owner was responsive, accommodating, and extremely welcoming. She made us feel right at home! The apartment was perfect as well. Clean, well decorated, and matched the photos to a tee! We especially appreciated the gorgeous view off the front balcony. The location also proved to be perfect. Close enough to Sydney, but away from the bustle of the city! It is less than a miles walk from multiple beautiful beaches, amazing restaurants, clothing and grocery stores. Overall, it was a true joy to stay here and we would more than recommend it to anyone wanting a stylish, comfortable, and relaxing stay in Sydney!\nAbsolutely beautiful place! Stayed here the night before my wedding and the night of! Was spacious, clean, felt warm and cozy, lovely decor, and just all around beautiful! Few mins walk to the beach! Would definitely recommend staying here :)\nTolle Lage: fussl\u00e4ufig zum Strand und zu den Gesch\u00e4ften. Eine wunderbar gestaltete Wohnung mit Blick f\u00fcrs Detail.

Back door wouldn\u2019t lock and was unlocked on arrival, after sending a video to try to get it fixed I never heard anything more on the matter.\nThis apartment is very close to everything: park (2min walk) with public swimming pool, shopping centre (5min walk), train station (15min), city (30min walk).<br\/>Stylish interior with plenty of space for the whole family (2 adults & 2 children).<br\/>Would've been good to have aircon but was not a problem for the duration of our stay in November. Plenty of airflow to cool down during the night, no bug screens though.<br\/>Overall a nice experience.\nGreat location, very noise proof to the busy street, very close to shops and central train station. Walls between rooms were thin though, you could hear conversations from the corridor or bedroom next door. <br\/>There was also mould in the dishwasher, and live cockroaches on the floor,  cutlery drawers so we would use takeaway cutlery to eat our food. One of the showers as well which has the washer and dryer has uneven flooring which meant that water would flow and pool all the way through the bathroom, and we would have to place towels on the ground to soak up the water which would eventually be completely saturated with water.  <br\/>The showers can also not be used at the same time as only one shower can use hot water at once.<br\/>Beds were very comfortable, and the fans in each room were a welcome in the heat. Overall the stay was pleasant, provided we avoided opening the kitchen drawers and showering one at a time. Location was very convenient to explore. Would stay again with bug spray.\nGreat place to stay! Convenient location.

Je recommande !!\nGreat apartment and location. Would definitely stay again !\nLack of air-con really hurts - we were there at the end of April and the apartment was still uncomfortably warm without the balcony doors open - meaning street noise becomes very intrusive.<br\/>Shower design is problematic - water just collects and ends up seeping out all over the bathroom floor. Awkward and messy.<br\/>Seems odd that the place has a washer and dryer but no iron.<br\/>Also didn't provide any coffee making facilities - we left a little plunger behind for future occupants, because not everyone likes to start their day with instant coffee!<br\/>Otherwise, great location. Comfortable beds. A nice vibe being in the place. Pretty good value, all up, given how overpriced Sydney is.\nA two-bedroom apartment on City Rd, Chippendale, very close to Broadway, University of Sydney, glebe, Redfern station, Ultimo and Central station. Clean and tidy, well equipped, clean, comfortable beds. Quiet and secure. Nice rear balconies. Great location with a coffee shop downstairs.\nGreat location, excellent amount of space, loved the kitchen!\nI can\u2019t even sleep for a night when I was there. It is very hot when I still there. The fan doesn\u2019t work at all. I can only open the window and door. The mosquitoes is annoying all the night. When I told the customer service, they just said they were working on the problem. I didn\u2019t get any help before I checked out. I have really bad experience in the apartment. The apartment is too close to the street. It is very noisy all the time. The bathroom is leaking. When I shower, the water from the bathroom flows all over the living room. On the first day of my stay, there were cockroaches crawling all over the bed and towels, and there were more than one. I tired to communicate with customer service. They just ignored me. It is totally unacceptable.\nGreat little place to stay. We had a couple of hiccups with remotes, fans and microwave not working but the we weren't in the house long enough for these things to matter. We told the Airkeeper team and they were quick to respond to let us know they would be looked at. The location was wonderful, check-in very easy, comfortable beds and great linen to sleep in. Overall really happy with our stay. thank you"}

It was conveniently located with public transport close by (bus, light rail and ferry). Getting there from the airport was easy. There are multiple cafes within 100m, a Woolworths, and The Star Casino with shows and restaurants. We spent an afternoon walking from the apartment along the waterfront in Pyrmont, past Darling Harbour and Barangaroo, to Circular Quay and then caught the ferry back. Patricia was very helpful with information on getting to the Opera House prior to our stay as we attended a concert there. <br\/>The apartment is very comfortable and was spotlessly clean. It is very light and gets a cross breeze when the sliding doors at either end of the apartment are open. Although, the weather was very hot while we were there, so we tended to keep everything closed and ran the reverse cycle air-conditioning in the living room and bedroom. Everything you needed for a relaxing weekend away was provided. Patricia really has thought of everything.\nPatricia's AirBnB was lovely to stay in from start to finish. She was incredibly helpful from the get go, and very responsive. Patricia's place was immaculate, well furnished and we felt right at home the whole stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb and Patricia as a host to anyone looking to stay in Pyrmont - Thank you Patricia! xo\nI had the most amazing stay at Patricia\u2019s! Her accommodation is so modern and stylish, the location is perfect and so close to everything and it was so easy to get to from the airport. The home itself is so beautiful the highlight for me being the balcony, very quirky and cute. Her place had everything I needed and I would highly recommend her stay for anybody visiting Sydney for the weekend - worth the price and worth the stay, thank you so much Patricia.\nPatricia was really lovely and great to communicate with. She was very accomodating. <br\/>Her place was very nice, close to a lot of things so it was very convenient!\nPatricia\u2019s home was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was unbeatable, with easy access to top attractions, restaurants, and transport. Highly recommend!\nA very thoughtful lot curated location! Lots of wonderful additions in the kitchen, personal touches! It was lovely and super super walkable to the CBD (whilst remaining out of the congestion). This location was great at public transport was right outside with the bus and light rail only 10 meters away\nThanks Patricia for the stay. Comfy, clean and beautifully styled. The bed was comfortable and we appreciated the kitchen facilities. Good cafes locally and a close walk to the darling harbour.\nReally nice stay, Patricia was an excellent host.

Kitchen was great with everything we needed including, oil for cooking great BBQ and even paper towel. The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows. Sarah had plenty of shampoo, lotions and great cooling fans. She had even left a bottle of wine and some nibbles for our arrival. It\u2019s a very flat easy 20 minute walk to Queenscliff beach. The only problem I found was trying to get a park on the street because we arrived later in the afternoon. I had a previous Airbnb booking in the Manly area but canceled that and booked Sarah\u2019s place because it was much more affordable.

The aircon in the main bedroom was great but the aircon in the lounge room was a portable aircon that leaked into a bucket at the back.

The location was good and the unit itself was decent but had a few flaws to it. The walls were thin and you could hear noises through the walls. There is also no door for the bathroom for those of you who want to share the place. <br\/>First off, the host wouldn\u2019t allow me to drop off my bags early so I had to work around that (whatever).

Only one towel was provided which I asked for another towel and the host wanted to charge me a fee for that.

We could not have been made more welcome. Our lovely hostess gave us a great in-house tour ensuring we knew where everything we needed was. Loved the interior and the key-less entry!! We\u2019re so glad we found your house and hope to stay with you next visit. <br\/>p.s. the welcome gifts were delicious. Thank you!!\nA great stay for a family with two kids thanks you\nLovely for a couple. Bedrooms need blackout blinds.\nOur stay in Balmain went very well. The house was well located, and met our expectations. Everything went very smoothly. We recommend this property.\nThank you for a wonderful stay, the house was beautifully decorated and fully equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Would love to come back.\nAmazing location and beautiful interior made us feel right at home as soon as we walked in the door. <br\/>Easy to warm up with the cold weather, keyless access and great facilities helped immensely with young kids.<br\/>The owners paid great attention to little things and the welcome gifts were warmly appreciated.<br\/>One small problem with the door lock fixed very quickly with the owner driving to us themselves. <br\/>I could not recommend this place more and will try to book next time in Sydney!\nWe really wanted to love this place- great location, lovely looking & nice touches throughout home. However there was a really strong musty smell in the house, perhaps from being left vacant or from mould, we don't know. The bedroom cleared a good bit after the first night but we still woke up with red itchy eyes every morning and from the downstairs both had sore throats and just felt pretty awful. We got in touch with MaisonNets expressing how challenging it was and that we'd had to get a diffuser to try manage the smell. We also expressed our disappointment considering the very high price we paid and the only reason we stayed was because we had a busy week & didnt have the time & energy to look & find something elsewhere. Despite this we did sleep elsewhere the last night but didn't bother saying it to them as while they replied politely to our messages, didn't offer any tangible suppport. I am always very fair in my reviews and dont like to be negative but this was our experience.\nGreat place to stay\nNot a bad place but not really worth it\nGreat location, lovely little house with good amenities. Perfect for couples."}

Peter was friendly and approachable, particularly enjoyed sitting out on the terrace\nReally nice spot nestled away in the Northern Beaches area, which is a fantastic area of Sydney. Despite being on the same property as Peter and Chris, there is plenty of privacy and it never felt as though we were encroaching on their space. <br\/>Plenty of room, and plenty to do.

Their main property is right next to the house and made it convenient for any asks, like umbrellas when we were caught in the summer rain!\nWe absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful little house. From the beginning the house was beautifully presented, all the essentials and more were there. We were greeted with a wonderfully put together guide book of Avalon Beach and Palm Beach and surrounding areas. Even additional items were thought of and provided such as beach towels, coffee pods, milk and bread, mosquito spray and many more. Situated in a lovely quiet area in walking distance to the centre and driving distance to everything. Highly recommended for a couple or with children, we stayed with our two boys.<br\/>Regards Merima & Kai\nPerfect stay for our family of 4. Our expectations were definitely exceeded, Peter and Chris have done an excellent job stocking the little house with everything you could need for your stay and more. Kids toys and beach towels were thoughtfully provided. The bedrooms seemed more spacious than pictured and also had big build in wardrobes which was a plus! We felt right at home and found the location to be super peaceful.\nPeter and Chris were amazing hosts who made us feel very welcome from the beginning. <br\/>They were very helpful with providing a list of recommendations and offered any assistance if needed. The place was absolutely beautiful and certainly made our stay feel relaxed and gave us that beach town experience we were hoping for. <br\/>They even went as far as providing some toys and books for our daughter to use on our stay which was something we didn\u2019t expect but very much appreciated. I would definitely recommend staying here as you will be looked after and you\u2019ll have a relaxing stay.\nExcellent logement beaucoup de d\u00e9tails un grand merci pour les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du petit d\u00e9jeuner et votre accueil chaleureux <br\/>Le linge de maison et les draps sont d\u2019en excellent confort et les ustensiles de cuisine de grande qualit\u00e9\nWe loved staying at Peter and Chris\u2019s place.

Everything was very clean and in great condition. <br\/>Peter and Chris went above and beyond with all the extra touches; a printed manual with what to do in the area, kids toys, picnic set, fresh bread, chocolate (as well as usual pantry items). <br\/>Thank you again for having us!\nIt was good\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\nWe could not fault Peter and Chris\u2019 place in any way at all: it was amazing, so nicely decorated and had a well thought out design.  <br\/>Our hosts communicated well and, clearly, they have thought of everything a guest could possibly need whilst staying there. With their helpful recommendations we went to places and on walks we never knew existed (even though we are Sydneysiders ourselves!). To this, I say, we have found a gem.

Adding photos of what the token look like, key box, vs mail box would remove unnecessary questions.\nSpacious apartment, quite convenient, 5min from the station!<br\/>It was a bit tricky to enter the apartment but the owners are very collaborative and helpful.<br\/>We were not lucky as the building alarm rang very loudly during the first night at 2am, the firefighters came to disalarm it 30min later, there were no big deal.<br\/>Other than that everything was nice!\nGreat spot!\nThank you Xian.<br\/>It has been nice stay.\nOne day lifts not working and then after only one lift working.

Good location across the road from the train station.\nEven after arriving 5 hours later than check in time, the room was not cleaned and super messy and dirty from the previous guest.

The cleaner came to clean the room but only spent about 10min in the room \u201ccleaning\u201d. The room was still dirty only the towels and the bedding were exchanged. Additionally, the room was advertised for two people but was way too small to fit any luggage as well as two people.

The location was perfectly positioned near stores and plenty of restaurants. Close by public transport with access to Sydney cbd\nGreat host\nGreat location, super convenient. Man was very responsive and helpful\nPros: great location, extra bed\/study, parking space, spacious <br\/>Cons: uncomfortable and stained couch, TV not programmed and unable to be used (informed owner but nothing was done), limited hot water for shower at night, kitchen sink tap was loose, bathroom light switch broken, bed with no doona cover (duvet sandwiched between flat sheets), only 1 key card available to share\nGreat location. Well maintained and clean. Very responsive host.\nTV didn\u2019t work, bathroom floor was filthy. Second bedroom was not a bedroom, more a study nook with a bed, and curtain as a \u201cdoor\u201d. Couch was disgusting, covered in stains and dust. Kitchen sponges and cloths needed replacing. <br\/>The shower had no hot water, and the water pressure was terrible. <br\/>Had to leave early due to family reasons, was a blessing in disguise.\nNice place! Nice location! Nice host\nMagi\u2019s apartment is in the heart of Chatswood surrounded by restaurants and shopping centres. It\u2019s walking distance to Chatswood metro station. Comes with free parking so that is a real bonus\nMagi is a great host and was very responsive to every request I had! The airbnb was in a great location right next to everything you could need. Definitely recommend!"}
{"listing_id":1141731634699139510,"comments":"All Air B & B are over priced , a general comment not just reflective of Glens  facilities .\nThe stay was disappointing. The lack of privacy made it uncomfortable. Not recommended for a romantic getaway.\nNice comfortable place to stay. Glen was very friendly and helpful.\nHad a lovely stay at Glen\u2019s place, The place was very modern, comfortable and clean and he was very friendly and helpful when I needed help\nI returned to Glen's place this past month, and it was clean, organised and comfortable. It is easily accessible, in a great location, and both Glen and his partner have fantastic communication with their guests. Their response time is good, and they are happy to answer any questions and requests with no trouble. A smooth and easy check in, and you have your own space and privacy. I enjoyed my stay.\nGlen\u2019s place, regardless if he is new to being a host, was incredibly clean and organised. Well set up, has its own kitchen and washing machine should you require. Located in a rather calm neighbourhood. Glen was available to contact if\/when it was required and answered in a timely manner. Would recommend it for people who require a homey environment for their stays.\nI think Glen is fairly new to the Airbnb business, but he and his wife have done a great job to set up and equip this accommodation. Comfortable bed, aircon, very clean, and what stood out for me was the generous size of the main room which has the lounge, dining and bed. Many others I\u2019ve stayed at feel cramped and dark. This one has very good natural light, with a large window with view to a well kept backyard. No traffic noise. Neighbourhood dogs went to sleep early so I found the location very quiet. Off the road parking was a plus. I suspect I will be staying there again.\nPerfect self contained unit with everything you need"}

The house is in a lovely part of north Sydney however access to the house is only available via approximately 15 very steep steps with limited near by parking so getting 6 people's luggage (4 children included) out of the car and to the door was a very difficult process - this wasn't made clear in the listing as it only says stair access from street. <br\/>Unfortunately the house was not cleaned to the standard you would expect from an AIRBNB as bathroom had not been cleaned at all, and other areas were also not clean. Hosts were very responsive and apologetic, and gave a small refund on the cleaning and offered to have cleaners return (appreciated but we had already cleaned). We were also not aware that this was the hosts own home with a lot of their own belongings and items everywhere.

The house was superb, with amazing beach view, very well equipped kitchen, clean and tidy, generous amount of coffee pods, a backyard that overlooks the ocean while cooking bbq for the family, ensuites are great for our big family, and we just love the decor in the house. We spent time bodyboarding, cycling around the lagoon, fishing near the Narrabeen bridge, and watching sunset sunrises from the house! Thank you so much and we\u2019d love to be back again!!\nLa casa es perfecta para familias,<br\/>buenos espacios funcionales, muy bien decorada y equipada.\nLocation, location, location, this house is one to remember as your backyard is the beach that provides an amazing backdrop to any holiday with lots to do in the water. Our family had an amazing time as the house has lots of different living areas for everyone to hide away when they want while also providing lots of opportunities to spend time together. The kitchen and dinning areas were great to have those memorable family dinners and each level has the flexibility for that inside outside living.  The house is well kitted out and is located a short walk to cafes and bars or a few minutes in the car to the shops to restock supplies. We had a great time and will definitely be back.\nIt was the perfect location to relax at the property or on the beach.  It is also located close to great restaurants and cafes.\nOur stay Christmas 2024 at Maison de la Mer was nothing short of extraordinary! Nestled along the Pacific shoreline, this property combines luxury with the serene charm of coastal living. Every detail thoughtfully designed to create a truly unforgettable experience.<br\/>We were captivated by the breathtaking ocean views visible from nearly every corner of the house. The home itself spans three levels, the multiple living and dining areas provided ample space for our family group to gather or enjoy quiet moments apart. Both the main kitchen and the half-sized kitchen were well-stocked, making it a joy to prepare meals while soaking in the panoramic views. <br\/>Maison de la Mer truly felt like a home away from home. We left feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and already dreaming of our next visit. Thank you for sharing your slice of paradise with us!\nPerfect location for any event. Separate levels allows for different groups to enjoy all the space. <br\/>Amazing place would stay there again in a heartbeat.\nWe had the most incredible experience at Maison de La Mer! The property was the perfect setting for our wedding, allowing us to celebrate with our closest friends and family in an unforgettable location. The beachfront views are absolutely breathtaking\u2014truly a dream come true. From the stunning surroundings to the impeccable hospitality, everything exceeded our expectations. We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful and memorable venue. Highly recommend!\nMaison De La Mer is an incredible holiday home - we have had a beautiful time visiting family.  The property has everything you need & more - Taylor is a brilliant host & helped us so much.  Its location is breathtaking & hypnotising - we can\u2019t wait to return!  Thank you! X"}

Beyond that it\u2019s very thoughtfully designed and decorated and welcoming for guests (with limited clutter and lots of free space for clothes, shoes etc.) The front yard is private and peaceful and the cubby house was highly entertaining for our kids.

It's a stunning home with a beautiful garden where my children played constantly and where we sat out on the patio and ate our meals.<br\/>The location is perfect. Great cafe and liquor store two small blocks away. Superb cafes, bakery and restaurants a 5 minute walk in the other direction and the stunning Bondi Beach just 18 minutes walk away. It was great for us as the street and house is quiet, yet easily accessible to the action.<br\/>The decor is beautiful and uncluttered, we felt so comfortable. Two living areas, good sized bedrooms, two bathrooms and two outdoor areas meant we could all spread out.<br\/>One room has a triple bunk, so can actually fit 3 kids which is ideal.<br\/>The general feeling of the home and details were better than what we expected from the photos.<br\/>Anna was delightful to communicated with. We can't fault our stay.  We will be back and can't recommend this house enough!"}

It's also worth noting that there are no doors between the kitchen\/bedroom and the bathroom\/toilet, which is great fun when there are two of you and the other needs to go to the toilet, if you know what I mean \ud83d\ude2c<br\/>Apart from that the apartment has good value for money.\nGreat value, locations superb and very comfy stay.\nThe host was responsive and the place was fine, but the dryer wouldn't dry, the dishwasher didn't work, and the shower pressure was very low. Otherwise the place was very clean.\nThis property suited my needs, was a close walk to public transport, shops and a short drive to the beach. Location was great!\nHilton reply to messages and solved problems very quickly. The place cleaned and comfortable.\nIt had few cockroaches, but the space was cleaned. They might enter inside using any small hole, not sure.\nNice little cabin in a discreet spot\nWe stayed 2 nights and it was perfect for what we needed. It is small but still spacious and have all the essentials.\nJust as described and in a great location\ngreat place, perfect for two or one ppl\nGood little air bnb for an overnight stay in Sydney close to entertainment venues. Had enough amenities for a quick trip but would not be as suitable for someone looking for a long stay. Easy to get to by car or Uber and definitely easy to walk to during the day if you had places to visit in the area.\nLa tiny house est assez spacieuse proche de Junior Kingsford pour prendre le tram\/bus donc tr\u00e8s facile d\u2019acc\u00e9der au centre de Sydney.<br\/>Tout \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la description. <br\/>Seul b\u00e9mol : la douche n\u2019\u00e9tait pas top (pas de pression + eau de la douche qui coule sur le sol).<br\/>Tr\u00e8s bon rapport qualit\u00e9 prix dans un quartier tr\u00e8s calme !\nHiltons place was as described. It was a tiny home, definitely a DIY job. Could do with having some stuff fixed up, bathroom floor flooded every time you had a shower. <br\/>Overall the area was in a good location for staying within Sydney."}

{"listing_id":1155274996596652744,"comments":"The location is good, close to the city. The only downside is that the train station to go to the city is a 16 min walk. <br\/>The house offered everything we needed and the space is great. We found the backyard a bit dirty so we didn\u2019t use it as much as we would like. <br\/>Overall it was a good experience.\nWould recommend staying at Elena\u2019s property for a peaceful getaway in a great location.\nAmazing location, loved the cafe two doors down. The place itself is as it is described, linen and beds were clean and comfortable and it had everything we needed. The kids loved the park across the road and the dog loved the big oval! Great stay, thanks for having us!\nWe have really enjoyed our 2 months stay in this lovely terrace. The house is located in a tree lined street opposite a large park and two doors away from a friendly coffee shop. It\u2019s two bedrooms well suited us and an adult daughter who worked from home a few days each week. It is within a short walk of a local supermarket, chemist and lots of coffee shops and restaurants as well as the newly opened Waterloo metro station plus buses to Newtown and Broadway. Parking across the road and in the lane behind us was relatively easy with only a few times when we had to look in surrounding streets. The house is well equipped for a long stay with lots of cupboard and drawer space, comfortable rugs and a lovely sunny courtyard. The hosts were responsive to our queries and entrance to the property very early on a Saturday morning was easy.\nHuge Airbnb that provides all the comforts you need for a stay. Nice lounge, and upstairs area and great location to cute cafes, pubs and the surrounds that Alexandria has to offer. Can\u2019t fault it."}
{"listing_id":1155337742139086105,"comments":"What a stunning place! It was hard to leave the views and location is close to everything you need in Balmain. The home feels like home and it was immediately comfortable from the moment we opened the door! <br\/>We would recommend to anyone and hope to be back some day soon.\nGreat place to stay. Looking forward to coming back. Street parking was easy to find.\nWe had a fantastic week at Harbour Haven Townhouse. Property is in a great location - close to Darling Street shops and restaurants and pubs but off the beaten track enough that there's very little traffic noise. Despite no off street parking, we didn't have any issues getting an unlimited car park - usually right out the front of the property. A short drive or 25 minute walk to Balmain and Balmain East ferry terminals made exploring all of Sydney very easy. Property was very clean, has recently renovated bathrooms and two outdoor areas with amazing views of the harbour. Our only feedback would be there could be a few more drinking glasses available."}

The room was different from what we booked\nWe planned to stay here for 2 weeks but we had to leave after 5 days as the place was filthy. The bedroom was clean and as described but smelt like mould. The bathrooms and kitchen were so dirty!! Grease lined every surface, drawer and appliance in the kitchen so you didn\u2019t want to touch anything. The fridge hadn\u2019t been cleaned and the kitchen bin was overflowing with rubbish onto the floor. There was barely enough cutlery for everyone to use but we honestly avoided cooking at all costs as it was so dirty. The bathrooms were covered in mold, hair everywhere from other guests, poo staining the toilet it was GROSS. I asked the host to come and clean after describing all of the issues and all he did was hoover the floors and empty the bins\u2026 this is not a clean!!<br\/>Luckily we managed to refund the majority of what we paid.\nTr\u00e8s pratique pour les voyageurs qui prennent l'avion et sont de passage.\nGreat stay near the airport!\nVery responsive host- willing to make adjustments for an early check in :)\nThank you for your stay."}

There was only one air conditioner in lounge room so the bedrooms were quite warm and at this time of year in summer it\u2019s not 100% ideal. Fortunately there were fans, however prefer air conditioning.\nGreat place to stay to visit the city of Sydney. Manly beaches were very close and easy to travel to the city with the Ferry which is a must if you are new to Sydney. You have Coles, Aldi, Woolworths (and Dan Murphy's) within 2min with a car and a couple restaurants and coffee within walking distance. Bus stop is almost at the building so that was perfect. The place was impecable, the only downside we found was the car street noise at times which wasn't a big deal if we are out to experience the city and at best you can close the windows, put the aircon on and forget about it. Fans provided for every room to keep the air flowing. Great for the price as Manly in general can be a bit pricey. We enjoyed the time there.\nGreat location.\nLiedess\u00e4 vain yhdess\u00e4 polttimossa kaasu pysyi auki. Pyyhkeet olivat ohuet ja niist\u00e4 irtosi nukkaa iholle. S\u00e4ngyt toisessa makuuhuoneessa oli tosi kovat. Automme ei mahtunut korkeuden takia parkkihalliin, mutta kadun varrella oli ilmaista pys\u00e4k\u00f6id\u00e4. Manly beach ja kaupat olivat k\u00e4velymatkan p\u00e4\u00e4ss\u00e4. Pidin itse hintaa korkeana, mutta alueen hintatasoon verrattuna hinta oli edullisimpia katselemistamme kohteista.\nKimi\u2019s apartment exceeded our expectations, was spacious, light filled and clean with a bathrooms attached to each bedroom, plenty of space to move around and spotless kitchen and living room.<br\/>We were extremely happy with our choice of apartment.<br\/>Only negative was a noisy road partially blocked by well fitted windows.<br\/>Overall experience was very pleasant.<br\/>I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Kimi\u2019s place to stay in\nClean, private and accommodating.

Would highly recommend.\nBeautiful home well presented easy access.<br\/>Highly recommend staying\nA beautiful period home reflective of Rozelle\u2019s unique character and charm. Perfectly located to shops, the harbour, lovely walks and the CBD.\nI cannot say enough good things about Annie\u2019s cottage. <br\/>I\u2019m not sure the photos quite do it justice. The cottage is beautifully renovated and thoughtfully comfortable, with lovely bedrooms and tons of pillows and towels. The kitchen is very well-appointed; we are at least two meals a day at home and never found that we were missing a key kitchen tool or dish. It was quite hot outside, but the a\/c was more than adequate for our over-air-conditioned American tastes.<br\/>The location is perfect. On the main drag just between Rozelle and Balmain, with plenty of restaurants and grocers within walking distance or a 5 minute Uber. It\u2019s also a short walk to the Bay Run if you\u2019d like to exercise or sit by the water. <br\/>Finally, Annie was a stellar host. I had a couple of questions about the house leading up to check in and she responded within minutes.\nSuch a great cottage in the heart of Rozelle. <br\/>Comfy beds, lovely linen and everything in walking distance. <br\/>Parking can be a little tricky so we parked and left the car and took advantage of walking and Ubers. <br\/>Cannot wait to come back again.\nFelt like home and was comfortable.

Right next to the Rozelle and Balmain shops, plenty of cafes and pubs nearby and an easy walk to the ferry. Annie was super helpful and flexible with checking in and checkout timing. Highly recommend!\nGreat base to explore Sydney from we had a wonderful stay\n5 of us spent 2 nights at Darling Cottage and had an absolutely wonderful time. Annie was a fantastic host. She was easy to get hold of, friendly and responsive. Annie gave us lots of recommendations for local restaurants and cafes. <br\/>The cottage is beautiful! It is well equiped with everything you need and the decor is gorgeous. <br\/>All of the people in our group said how comfortable the beds were. <br\/>It is really close to the main street in Rozelle where all the shops, bars and restaurants are located. (Literally a 1 minute walk). <br\/>We even walked to Birkenhead Point outlet mall which is only an easy 30 minute walk from home.<br\/>I'd highly recommend Darling Cottage to anyone looking to stay in this part of Sydney. You won't be disappointed!\nA very charming and cozy place. Easily the best airbnb to date I\u2019ve been to. The 7 of us had a comfortable stay from start to end. Everything was really clean, toilets had everything. Thought went into setting up this place from the extension cords each side of the bed, extra floor mats  and really lush amenities. Not to mention the beautiful fireplace. It really felt like a home put together with love. The water heater for the shower worked amazing, all of us had enough for a long hot shower. Location wise, it\u2019s a 2 min walk to the bus stop and takes under 20 mins down to CBD. I would definitely want to come back here next time I\u2019m in Sydney. Thank you Annie for a wonderful stay\nGreat location, lovely spot for a cosy winter stay. Well stocked kitchen and Annie was an accomodating and flexible host. On behalf of Team Daniel thanks for having us!"}

No laundry facilities but cheap and quick laundromat a few hundred meters away.<br\/>Location was good, close to the beach, to restaurants and supermarkets, and close to public transport.\nLocation of apartment was handy and size of apartment was great. However there was an extremely strong smell of paint fumes which we could smell as soon as we opened the door and it was through the whole apartment. It was quite unbearable. I mentioned this to the owner and he advised it had been painted two months ago and refused to communicate further. The toxic smell was terrible. We were also disappointed in the \u201cfully equipped kitchen\u201d which had an extremely small egg flip, no tea towels, no oven mitts, no strainer, no basic essentials like salt pepper and olive oil which I\u2019ve found at every b and b. <br\/>Two blinds fell down.

Fantastic time!\nAmazing location! Helpful hosts!\nPerfect location with walking distances to everything around. Many bedrooms but only 1.5 bathroom so if you come in a big family, you will have to plan the schedule well. It\u2019s quite dusty and noisy at night as it\u2019s near the street but it\u2019s as expected. Milan is helpful and flexible, we will recommend this place anyway."}

Siya was very responsive prior to and during our stay, always answering our questions within a timely manner and providing appropriate information. <br\/>Upon arrival, there was a large amount of rubbish outside the house which was promptly removed once we informed the host. The house did lack cleanliness in some areas, specifically the bathrooms that looked like they could do with a deep clean, and the house did smell a bit funny (like there had been a large group drinking the night prior) on arrival however some fresh air cleaned it out. The courtyard could do with some outdoor furniture - eg a chair or table and a general tidy up. <br\/>Most amenities you would require were in the house including a well equipped kitchen, bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner and body wash) and laundry powder.\nThe house was all we needed for one night in the city with a group. Appreciated the early check in. <br\/>Only thing I didn't realise was that the bedroom downstairs is not the master room, it is a single with a seperate bathroom off of the main hallway. Larger double bedrooms are both upstairs.\nEasy to understand instructions. Good location and surroundings.

The location is walkable to Bondi beach and all the local shopping and restaurants. The apartment itself is much bigger than the photos depict and the design is beautiful. Do be aware there is no air-con in this apartment which is noted under amenities but which we had overlooked. This was a surprise to use given our visit in the heat of Australian summer, but the overhead bathroom fan and portable fan were helpful. We had to cut short our stay by 1 day, which the host was flexible with. It was nice that they sent a cleaning crew halfway through our stay. The only negatives were that both sets of keys provided did not work on the front door which we had to get replaced. Also the power was out one night which resulted in a construction crew jackhammering the driveway which lasted until 4am. We were forced to open the windows given the fans weren't working and did not sleep. Unfortunately no discount was given for the disruption. Overall would revisit\nWe LOVED our stay here in Bondi!!! It was our BEST AIRBNB we have stayed at!!! It was completely updated, furnished beautifully, immaculate and kitchen was well stocked for our Christmas dinner!

Thank you.\nWe had an absolutely amazing stay at this wonderful accommodation. It was so close to everything that we had planned to do perfect location for public transport and easy for uber pick ups. <br\/>It was spacious enough where we all had our own space when needed. It was clean and perfect couldn\u2019t flaw it. <br\/>The only downside was when we did our own thing there was only one key so had to make sure we were all finished or awake at the same time to be let in, however, that was only a small problem which we figured out after the first night<br\/>We loved our holiday to Sydney and the amazing accommodation made it 100x better \u263a\ufe0f\nGood location! Nice and clean.\nEverything was perfect. The transportation was convenient and the area near the accommodation was quiet. The place was incredibly clean and cozy. The Chinese restaurant nearby was also really delicious. If I come back to Sydney, I\u2019d definitely stay here again.\nI had the most wonderful time staying here! From the moment I arrived, everything exceeded my expectations. The check-in instructions are clear, flat was spotless, beautifully decorated, and equipped with everything I could possibly need.<br\/>The location is in a safe building with a delicious cafe and Woollie\u2019s nearby. 20 mins to CBD or Bondi by car and 30 mins or an hour by bus. The host, Grazy, was very responsive and so welcoming, going above and beyond to make my stay special.<br\/>The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing \u2013 I truly didn\u2019t want to leave! This place is a hidden gem, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to book again in the future. If you\u2019re looking for a cozy, luxurious, stay then this is for you!\nBrilliant apartment and host.

Ich kann das Airbnb nur weiterempfehlen!\nReally clean apartment.Good transport links with bus outside apartment to CBD.

Apartment is very clean and modern with everything you'd need (microwave, gas cooker\/oven, fridge\/freezer, washing machine, dryer, coffee machine etc). Pharmacy across the road and supermarket 2 mins walk away. Surrounded by coffee shops and cafes too. Good location for public transport being 15m walk from train station (Green Square which is on the Airport to City line) and a bus ride to Coogee Beach. Highly recommended.\nWonderful stay, place was beautiful and great location and grazy was really helpful with clear instructions and made me feel really welcome!\nGreat place to stay matches everything on the site\nThe accommodation worked perfectly for us for an overnight stay. Really clean and well presented - we will certainly return when the need arises.\nWonderful area and super quiet. Loved it\nThis is the cleanest and most beautiful place I\u2019ve ever visited so far! Super comfy, feels so homey, and has aesthetics. Also, the host was responsive and helpful. 10\/10 recommended! <3"}

I walked to Darling Harbour easily and also walked about 15-20 mins to the train station. The amenities were standard and clean. Good deal for a private room bnb. Thank you!\nRoom number one is downstairs and at the front of a lovely terrace on a quiet leafy street at the top of the Ultimo\/Pyrmont hill. I usually stay in local pubs\/hotels but this room was a little cheaper so I gave it a go. The property is well maintained with polished hardwood floors. Thick rugs upstairs and in the hall would add colour, character, and suppress the sounds of others moving around.\nOnly problem is checkin was late and dis not responded, had to wait outside, rest is amazing, good location clean house, everything was amazing\n\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6c9f\u901a\u6109\u5feb\uff0c\u623f\u95f4\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u5b89\u9759\u8212\u9002\nthe place is in good location ,  shower, kitchen and room good in conditions.

Good access to scenic boardwalks along the beach with great cafes and restaurants. The St George Sailing Club waterfront restaurant was a stand out either for coffee, drinks or the full lunch \/ dinner.\nEverything was clean and tidy. A very nice place to stay. The bed in the main room was very comfy. This would be a great place for a family with a couple of kids to stay. I felt very safe, and I had no problem getting a taxi. I would stay here again, no problems.\nLovely modern apartment, bigger than expected and so close to the beach and cafe. Such a relaxing stroll along the beach to more shops and restaurants at Ramsgate."}

Highly recommend.\nThe room was immaculate, well-appointed and beautifully decorated.<br\/>We definitely come back again if anytime we need it!\nI recently stayed at this Airbnb and unfortunately had a very negative experience. First off, the host didn\u2019t respond to my messages in a timely manner, which was frustrating and left me feeling unsupported. When I arrived, I found that the AC didn\u2019t work, and with the heat, it was incredibly uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t sleep properly the entire stay and ended up with headaches because of the temperature and humidity.<br\/>To top it all off, I had driven for over 9 hours from Brisbane to Sydney, expecting a relaxing place to unwind after such a long journey. Sadly, this was my first time visiting Sydney, and this stay was far from the welcoming experience I had hoped for. Definitely a letdown. Would not recommend this place to anyone looking for comfort or good hospitality.\nMavis is very responsive and willing to assist. Her accommodation is clean and makes us feel like home. We will definitely come back and recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay close to everything.\nWe had an absolutely fantastic time at this place! It was even more beautiful in person than the pictures showed. Spotlessly clean, well-maintained, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect and close to shops also peaceful and quiet at night.<br\/>The host was incredibly welcoming and responsive and I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy, convenient, and welcoming place to stay!<br\/>Thank you Mavis"}

It was very close to the local shops and cafes.  Parking is fine in the evenings but limited to 1 or 2 hours in most spots in the daytime but there were plenty around and I parked right opposite Joe\u2019s on a 2 hour free parking spot.  The studio was very clean and very well set up.  The kitchen was well equipped.  The bed very comfortable.  The night I stayed it was very quiet.  My one criticism was the bright light pouring in in the morning through the opaque glass doors and at night, at intervals, from the motion light shining in from outside.  I should have closed the roller door but I kept worrying I\u2019d get stuck inside.  It wouldn\u2019t be a problem for early risers!  The issue is easily solved with some heavy curtains.

Overall, we enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommend it!\nLocation of the unit was good and safe secure car park was excellent. Unit was not vacuumed properly on arrival.

Old & perished furniture in the unit , pictures online of the unit are very outdated.

We very much appreciated it.\nBeautiful Bondi gem - character place with full Reno and clean lines. Few minutes walk to the beach and awesome cafes. Bus around the corner. Handy local supermarket. Liz has fitted it out with comfy leather furniture and tasteful interiors. Liz\u2019s communication was A1 at all times including allowing an early check in. It felt like a stay in true old Bondi with its art deco and stained glass which is what we wanted rather than staying in a sanitised standard ultra modern apartment that could be anywhere.

Basically the place overall looks fine, but when you look at some corner is quite dusty, just like the behind the bedside, the router on the ground, and the first floor toilet.<br\/>Besides, the house is having some power issues, when some buttons turn on, the whole house electricity will be outage.<br\/>Is good that the host responds very quickly, helping us to find out the power box, bringing back the electricity.<br\/>If the host can tell us before we discover this issue, that would be helpful.<br\/>Besides, we find that the host leave us a pack of TimTam. Does surprise us\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb<br\/>For advice, can provide a hairdryer because we have female staying with us this time, and is very annoying they have to wait until the hair dry, to finally go to bed. <br\/>Hope you can do better in future\u2764\ufe0f\nSecond time staying in this property as we loved it so much the first time. 4 mins walk to the beach, shops, public transport and restaurants but also a really quiet street. Easy to check in and the host is really helpful.\nLiz was awesome, left a couple of surprises in the fridge which were very appreciated after flight. Responsive to a couple of questions we had.

And the key is in the mail box which is inside the building and you can\u2019t get in the building without the key. I had to wait outside in cold for long time for someone to open the main gate so that I can go to the mailbox to get the key for the apartment. The apartment in itself is fairly new but its just not welcoming, it just does not feel warm or welcoming.

They invited me to share a delicious meal with them, and were happy and easy to share conversation with.  It was easy for me to have my own space, they respected my privacy.<br\/>The house has an amazing location with calm, flexible and friendly hosts.  I felt good energy while staying here and would do it again.\nC\u2019\u00e9tait un s\u00e9jour agr\u00e9able dans la cabane dans les arbres, c\u2019est un lieux tr\u00e8s reposant, id\u00e9al pour se ressourcer. Alex et James ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s bons conseils, et d\u2019un accueil chaleureux ! \ud83c\udf1e\nMy stay at James and Alex's Tree House in Church Point was a fantastic experience! I was in Sydney for work, doing carpentry in nearby Palm Beach, and this spot turned out to be the perfect place to unwind at the end of each day. The treehouse itself is both comfortable and charming, with stunning views and a very welcoming vibe.<br\/>One of the highlights of my stay was the warm hospitality from James and Alex\u2014they were incredibly friendly and made me feel right at home. They even cooked some amazing dinners and invited me to join them, which was both generous and much appreciated after a long day\u2019s work.<br\/>If you\u2019re looking for a unique and comfortable place to stay with genuinely wonderful hosts, I highly recommend this treehouse. It made my work trip much more enjoyable, and I\u2019ll definitely be back!\nIsolated, quiet yet convenient to Mona Vale & Warriewood where you can find restaurants, grocery & some retail. Peaceful, rustic ambiance.  Naughty pine flooring (reminiscent of childhood in the States for me).  Dedicated bathroom.  Table\/chair workspace, if needed.  Older home on the slope of a hill.  ~30 steps to reach entrance on the balcony\/deck.  Bird singing constant - an occasional visitor will fly in for a daily snack on the banister.  <br\/>Alex & James, your hosts, are extraordinary.  Interesting, fascinating - both authors.  Accommodating with such a genuine interest in serving their guests.  A memorable experience.\nWe really enjoyed our time with Alex and James. They are really friendly and relaxed. The view from the Treehouse is amazing! Good place to relax, but also lot's of things to do (ask Alex for the Lighthouse walk!)\nIt's a wonderful place for relaxing and getting more in touch with the nature. Highly recommended!\nA very beautiful location\nWonderful stay in a beautiful area, very clean and everything we needed was provided. Alex and James were the best hosts we have ever had, super accommodating, helpful and kind. Highly recommend staying here for a peaceful and cosy getaway."}

Would definetly recommend this stay if you are looking to work quietly for a couple of days!\n\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\nVery good price compare to other properties at the same level!\nThank u! Was so clean and good\nCiara is a considerate and thoughtful host. Thanks again\nHeaps clean and no fuss. Would recommend\nMy experience was similar with other reviewers: the room was in ok condition, but the shared bathroom was not clean at all. In fact, by the way it looks, I don\u2019t think it gets cleaned often at all. When I checked in, I assumed the cleaners didn\u2019t get a chance to clean the bathroom yet. But no \u2014 that\u2019s just how it is.<br\/>The house is essentially a massive dorm. There are 5 bedrooms and it looks like a good portion of them are rented out through Airbnb. <br\/>The walls are very thin, so I could hear both of my neighbors laughing hilariously as they were watching TikTok before going to bed. And then I woke up very early in the morning because they were already doing their morning hygiene next door. And I slept in earplugs but could still hear them. Very annoying.<br\/>The room is upstairs and it was a very hot day. The room got very hot and there was no ventilation or AC at all. I asked the host if there was at least a fan I could borrow. Crickets. Never heard back.\nI absolutely recommend staying here! I spent 4 nights at this lovely place, and it was exactly as described\u2014clean, comfortable, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. Viola is a fantastic host, always quick to respond and incredibly helpful. The only minor downside is that it\u2019s a bit far from the CBD, but the house is conveniently close to a bus stop and situated in a beautiful neighborhood. Overall, a wonderful stay!\nGreat place to stay!\nOverall enjoyable stay. The biggest positive was the amazing water pressure in the upstairs shower and of course the affordable cost. The only thing the room could have done with was an AC. I could see a vent but couldn\u2019t quite work out how to get it working for the room, luckily things cooled down during the night. Viola is a great and responsive host. The room itself was very clean but some of the shared amenities could have used a bit of an extra clean, but it was all still manageable.\n\ubc29\uc740 \uae68\ub057\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uc774 \uc870\uc6a9\ud55c \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ubc24\uc5d0 \uc798\ub54c \uc870\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.<br\/>\ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ub9cc\uc871\ud568.\nEven the toilet was dirty, It's a good deal interms of price.\nThis Airbnb is in a beautiful, spacious house, and my room was cozy and clean. However, I found Viola to be a neglectful host and chose to leave after the first night, despite booking for four. Here\u2019s why:<br\/>\t1.\tCheck-In Issues: I arrived exhausted after a 36-hour flight. We had issues with the check-in: Viola initially wanted to delay it until 6 p.m. (despite the app stating 3 p.m.). Also, no one was there to greet me. <br\/>\t2.\tDirty Common Areas: Shared spaces were unclean, with hair in the bathroom, greasy counters, and no soap or toilet paper. Viola claimed that since I hadn\u2019t paid a cleaning fee, she only cleans on Sundays.<br\/>\t3.\tExcessive Heat: My room was unbearably hot, reaching over 30\u00b0C, forcing me to open the window for relief.<br\/>\t4.\tPoor Communication: Viola doesn\u2019t speak English and was slow to respond on the app.<br\/>I was grateful she refunded me for the remaining nights ( the least she could do in my opinion).\ngood place\nL\u2019\u00e9tat des lieux est jolie. Mais il mon voler de la boisson dans le frigo. Et c\u2019est un peu un manque de respect. Et dans les douche y\u2019avait des cheveux au sol"}

Overall, our experience was great and we highly recommend this place.\nIt\u2019s not bad.\nWould highly recommend to anyone needing accommodation in or near Marsden Park\nsufficiently appointed, well laid out and very comfortable for a large or extended family.\nFaisal was a great host. He was responsive and that allowed me to be confident when booking his place for my stay. The house was top tier with every room having its own fan which is great during the summer months. The ducted air conditioning was also such a lifesaver. There were plenty of amenities with a total of 2 bathrooms upstairs and 2 downstairs. I would highly recommend this place and may consider booking again.\nClean and tidy\nWe had a fantastic stay! The house was spacious, beautifully designed, and had everything we needed. It made for a very comfortable and relaxing experience. Highly recommend!\nFaisal was great at communicating and the building is brand new and very nice. We had one question while we were there and he was able to respond pretty promptly, however the issue was not resolved (mentioned later).<br\/>I don\u2019t believe the place is professionally cleaned as there was hair and dust all over the floor and windows\/window sills. There were 7 of us staying and only 3 towels were found inside, plus one was found on the washing line. We then discovered the other towels inside the washing machine, wet, the morning we were leaving, meaning we had to share towels.<br\/>I wouldn\u2019t have minded if it was suggested to bring towels to use.<br\/>Other than that, I think the location is great and it comfortably slept 7 of us.\nA beautiful home for mine and my girls' weekend getaway !

The only things I missed were an aircon and a dishwasher, which was made very clear in the listing. I felt that the property was worth the price. The neighbourhood was not great though, rubbish lying around, abandoned trolleys everywhere etc.\nVery nice and clean place\nWe enjoyed our stay in this apartment, very welcoming and homely.\nincredible stay and the team were incredibly accomodating! highly recommend!\nVery cute! The apartment was clean and smelt amazing! Lots of love and care went into the unit. Only thing to note is if you have big 4WD the vehicle won\u2019t fit into the garage but there is plenty of roadside parking. Avoid during summer as there is no aircon and on the top floor, so heat rises. There is 2 fans provided but has not much cooling effect when it is very humid. I definitely should have taken a closer look at the listing to check for aircon. We ended up having to cancel due to this and our puppy would have suffered due to overheating.\nThank you for the stay. Loved your place. Loved our stay.\nConditions inside the place 99.9% match the descriptions. Thoughtful decorations, lots of power outlets and extension strips. The quality of broadband speed was superb esp for me who needed to work in the place (work from \"home\"). <br\/>Some understandable problems: <br\/>The cupboard above the stove was coated with thick colourless grease with awful smell from previous occupants' cooking (frankly hard for a cleaner to see). Glad there was a bottle of Cif for me to DIY.<br\/>The neighbourhood of low-income area was an issue (but really couldn't be blamed), and I felt unsafe. Broken glass bottles, dozens of abandoned supermarket trolleys, discarded stained mattresses, cars with modified exhaust sounds running around at night. Of course, lots of roaches on street, they entered the flat and even crawled onto my leg once when I was watching TV!\nResponsive host. However, there was not a dryer or hair dryer when we arrived, as listed in the amenities. She came over that evening to deliver these, which we appreciate. <br\/>A bit rude, there was a closet with extras such as pillows, toilet paper etc. we used some towels from it. When she saw that, she was angry that they were for her personal use and took them away. They weren\u2019t marked differently or kept separately so beware you ask beforehand if any stuff is her personal. <br\/>The bathroom doesn\u2019t lock. <br\/>Also, theres a netted window in the living room. There was a storm that day, due to no air con\/fans, window was already open. Water came in onto a table right under the window which we didn\u2019t realise as we were in our rooms the entire storm duration. She was angry at that and took away all the decor that was displayed on that table. This was our first day there! Other than this, she is responsive and helpful. Decide for yourself!\nThis is my first Airbnb experience and I absolutely loved it. I felt a second home. I would definitely recommend to others. Thank you Doma homes.\nOne of the best Airbnb\u2019s I\u2019ve ever visited and I can\u2019t wait to come visit this place again ! Worth every single penny the place is very tidy and maintained\nNice unit, clean tidy well maintained. Access is a bit confusing but the comfortable beds and nice bathroom makes up for it. Owner leaves all the needs for a shower and the body wash is a wonderful sell that goes through the whole unit.\nVery responsible and responsive\nGreat accomodation"}
{"listing_id":1220234221483757213,"comments":"We felt really good and liked the neighborhood with the cafes, restaurants, take-aways and the close bus stop. Enmore Park is great and just a few minutes away. Plus the metro for shopping is very convenient. We liked it very much and hope to return again.\nThis listing did not match the images on Airbnb. It was a completely different apartment. The images suggested it was a one bedroom apartment however this was a studio with a wardrobe between the bed and living space (acting as a temporary wall). Additionally the second bed was pictured as a sofa bed however the couch was non-convertible and there were instead two thin unmade mattresses leaning up against the wall.<br\/>The hosts were limited in their support in resolving this, not responding to calls. When asked why the room differed from expectations the hosts offered to send cleaners the following day to provide linen for the mattresses. Overall poor experience, felt catfished.\nPrivate, comfy great place.\nVery nice BnB, clean and modern unit with good amenities, secured carpark with a reserved spot was a plus.\nI\u2019ve never written a negative Airbnb review, but this place was terrible.<br\/>The unit we were given was NOT the unit shown in on the listing. The place had no sofa bed so couldn't sleep the 4 people we had booked for! Also no tv or basic furniture.<br\/>I called the host. It wasn\u2019t \u2018Rob,\u2019 but a very rude woman who said she\u2019d look into it and hung up on me.<br\/>Got a text later that said, \u201cyou can stay my other unit GO3 first for tonight.\u201d No apology, nothing. When we found the other unit, it was being cleaned and wouldn\u2019t be available for another hour. It was after 6pm and my family just wanted to unpack and relax!<br\/>When we finally got in, it was a lousy studio with an air-con that began pouring water all over the floor after it was turned on.<br\/>I texted the host the next morning to let her know about the air-con and ask her where would sleep that night, she wrote, \u201cyou can have 108.\u201d Still no apology for the blatantly inaccurate listing.<br\/>These hosts treat you like dirt and don\u2019t deserve your money.\nI booked this place for my mother who travelled through from Victoria for a family event. The communication from Rob & Marie was great, with all information provided prior to check in. However, once my mother arrived at the accommodation she had a small issue locating the car park designated for her as there was no clear signage of where she was meant to park. She was able to find street parking close to her room which was somewhat ideal as she didn\u2019t want to walk too far. She also advised me that the room was spacious and very clean. The accommodation was also equipped with a fantastic bathroom \/ shower along with a comfy bed which made her stay even more comfortable. <br\/>My mother has now returned back to Victoria and advised it is a fantastic modern place in a good location close to shops etc. She\u2019d highly recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere affordable to stay as she would happily stay there again. <br\/>Thanks again Rob & Marie for their great hospitality during my Mums stay!\nRob was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The apartment complex has been recently built and I was upgraded to a two bedroom apartment which was very spacious. There is a bus stop close by which allows access to the city and suburbs. There is some noise from the planes but this didn't bother me. On the ground floor there is an excellent Spanish restaurant. Highly recommend."}

The house layout has a few quirks that some guests may want to know in advance. For example, it's a 3-storey place and some sections of stairs don't have handrails\/guards. There is also a step\/platform by some of the beds, which can be a surprise at night\/ in the dark.

That place was great for a few nights stay and located in a really picturesque area. Worth staying a few days so you have time to explore the area nearby.\nHost was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. The shack is pretty basic but matches description. No ladder on bunk bed which would make it very tricky for an under 12 year old to access, bit wobbly also. <br\/>Nil air con but pedestal fans provided.

Terrific location close to light rail, train, metro and bus. Close to restaurants and supermarkets.\nHost was proactive & responsive. I am very disappointed though that room reeked of cigarette smoke smell which seems to have seeped on surfaces\/furniture. I arrived around 6pm, room felt like an oven after a 32-degree sunny weather & had to pull out the 'portable cooling' fan from a cabinet. Noted that there is no ACU which I'm ok with as long as appliance functions well. Tray was flaky from dried up water, making it look like it had not been used for a while, grills rusty or dirty. Fan does not swivel as it should & is not enough to cool the entire room after a hot weather. . . had to sit right in front of the fan to cool. 1 window was sealed\/screwed in shut (can't be opened to circulate the air) & the smaller window can't be fully opened.  Due to sensitivity to cigarette smoke, I started having difficulty breathing & could not rest or sleep. By ~11pm, I had to move to a hotel late at night at my own expense then moved to another listing the next day.

Tiles in the kitchen area were loose and cracked. All in all the property seemed very worn out and tired it  needs a lot of maintenance. I feel we over paid for something that didn\u2019t really resemble the pictures. The location was great but for the price we paid for 2 nights wasn\u2019t worth it for how run down it was. Very disappointing\nThe location of this property is excellent, and the host was very responsive, which we appreciated. The apartment is nicely furnished, but it does show signs of wear and could benefit from some updates.<br\/>There were a few maintenance concerns, such as a wet patch of carpet on arrival and some challenges with the bathroom fittings, but the host did their best to address our requests promptly. Additionally, we had to request a baby high chair that was advertised to always be at the listing and provide our own linen for the cot, which we hadn\u2019t expected. The pool and observation deck were lovely but often busy, making it harder to relax.<br\/>Overall, the apartment has a lot of potential, and with some improvements, it could offer an even more enjoyable stay.\nGreat place to stay! Worth the money. Located in the heart of Rocks- everything is in a walking distance. Apartments are really nice and clean. We'll definitely come back next time!\nVery convenient & short walking distance to several points of interest within the city. Very close to the fireworks display.

The Wi-Fi connection was extremely slow and often disconnected, frustrating as I needed it for work. The room itself was much smaller than advertised in the listing, which felt misleading.<br\/>The cleanliness was a major issue. There was dust all over the table and even on the bed. The bed linen was visibly dirty, which made the stay uncomfortable.

The house itself was very spacious, clean and exactly as it is described. The photos are very accurate. I highly recommend this property for a stay in Bondi.\nMarc's house was very cozy, clean and at a great location. There was plenty of room to sleep and relax, there was amply natural lighting which made the house feel bright. Since the location was so great, we went to the beach everyday!

As per other reviews, I think that he's cleaners are letting him down.<br\/>We needed to do some washing (as we were on a road trip), but the drier had washing in it and the drying wrack also had wet towels still hanging on it on the varanda (presumably from the previous guest).<br\/>This was not a good look for \"luxury accomodation.<br\/>Other than that, it was a lovely stay with all you need and I would reccomend it. Great coffee just around the corner.\nThis place is on point & will be my go to place when staying in Sydney. Beautiful, spacious unit with location location. Easy walk to the city.

Very pleased. Would stay there again\nGreat place to stay! Would definitely go back! Lovely host!\nCannot fault the fabulous location, general set up or host\u2019s kind and quick communication. However to help meet the luxury label, the unit needs some repair, a stocktake of linens and perhaps clearer instruction to the cleaner. We realised one bed had no sheets on it just before bedtime and could only find one flat sheet which we used in place of a fitted sheet. We also couldn\u2019t find enough towels - managing to find 4 bath towels, 1 hand towel and 1 facewasher for 4 guests. The Nespresso machine had the wrong size pods supplied so couldn\u2019t be used. <br\/>Some repair is needed. The bath plug didn\u2019t stay down so the bath wasn\u2019t usable. One shower leaked and the other shower fitting was loose. The carpets in the bedrooms didn\u2019t fit across the room with a trim patched with scraps.<br\/>We communicated these issues to Zhenbin who was apologetic.  We didn\u2019t ask for it to be corrected in our visit but hope it\u2019ll be corrected for future guests to enjoy.\nGreat place!\nWhilst the location was 10\/10, the apartment had only been partially cleaned for our arrival. Both bins under the sink were full with previous guests food scraps. Quite smelly. The 2nd bedroom sheets etc had not been washed\/changed. The sheets were marked and hair and glitter present from previous guests. I assume Zhenbin\u2019s cleaner was in too big a rush?? We complained and Zhenbin apologised but it took the joy out of our arrival. <br\/>The Nespresso machine did not work and there were no pods. Both bedrooms had sections of carpet cut and removed along the skirting.\n\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u9ad4\u9a57\uff0c\u6709\u8eca\u4f4d\u3002\u5eda\u5177\u90fd\u5f88\u9f4a\u5168\u3002\u8d70\u8def\u6216\u642d\u706b\u8eca\u5c31\u80fd\u5230\u6b4c\u5287\u9662\u3002\nThe place is great, the instructions to get in agent clear.

Looked exactly like the photos and very clear communication from the host on how to access the apartment.<br\/>However, parking was extremely difficult and not very clear for first timers in Sydney! Especially coming from the UK, we did not understand the road signs and ended up with a hefty parking fine of 315 Australian Dollars on day 1. So please make sure you are aware of the signs and how to read them..because they are very different if you are coming from another country!<br\/>The shower is a nightmare to switch on and off, and to get to the correct temperature..it needs a manual in itself! We did think we cracked the code towards the end of our stay, but couldn\u2019t tell you how as you just have to keep turning both taps until you get it right. <br\/>And finally, we were not made aware of the construction that was happening next door which was extremely loud!! The builders started working at 7am and woke us up every morning of our \u2018holiday\u2019.\nThis place would have been great if it wasn\u2019t for the very strong mildew\/moldy smell in the whole apt. It was a bit hard to bare. We also saw a couple of roaches in the kitchen. The building is outdated as well, it would help if they included some photos of the exterior to avoid guests feeling deceived. The apt itself was decently renovated and thoughtfully decorated. Host communication was great. Located on a bit of a busy road but with some nice cafes nearby.\nIt is a lovely apartment with no distance to bindi junction, perfect location!"}

It's really spacious for Sydney, the rooms are big and beds really comfortable. There is a lot of common space to spread out in, which makes it feel really relaxing as everyone can have space outside of their rooms. It was spotlessly clean. Easy off street parking spot too. This will definitely go on my top place to stay in Sydney.\nGreat place, perfect for a weekend away.

The listing describes the apartment as \"chic,\" but that\u2019s far from reality. The furnishings are cheap and substandard, including flimsy bed frames and low-quality towels. Basic amenities like sufficient mugs and glasses for a group of six or more were missing. The master bedroom\u2019s air conditioner emitted a strong moldy odor, making it uncomfortable to sleep. Additionally, the bathroom exhaust fan was broken, causing the entire bathroom to fill with steam every time we showered. Despite raising this issue on the first day, the host took two days just to acknowledge the fault, and after five nights, it was never fixed. Host was unresponsive and dismissive, showing little willingness to address concerns. We had to chase for updates, only to be met with delays.

The place was as cozy as in the photos and would definitely book again if I happen to be back in Syd!\nI booked the unit for a short stay and it was perfect for what I needed -  compact but comfortable, and no extra cost to have the sofa bed set up. Khai was very responsive and helpful setting up Wifi access, etc. <br\/>Thank you Khai!\nNice place to stay in<br\/>Tidy and clean\nEveryone satisfied\nKhai's place is a beautiful unit, all the lovely period architectural features and beautifully converted. It has everything you might want for a slightly longer stay in Ashfield, close enough to all the fantastic food on Liverpool Rd but with everything you need in a small kitchen to self cater, and walking distance to the shops. It was super hot and humid the weekend I was in town, and the AC was such a relief! The only thing I'll mention is that mattress in the bedroom was quite firm, worth noting if that's not your preference.<br\/>Khai was a delight as a host, very proactive and helpful. I had no problems at all during my stay but I have no doubt they would have been fixed quickly if I had. I'll certainly keep this unit in mind next time I'm in town."}

Very easy to get to the city. Peaceful. Loved the huge balcony and also the massage chair. We will be back!!!\nI stayed for 4 nights. The house needs renovation especially the bathrooms. Outside area was very dirty. Couch placed outside was full of dust. After looking the pictures of the outside we thought we could have breakfast or dinner outside but it was not cleaned so we had a chance to sit outside. There is o ly 1 AC in the living area. In hot days that doesn't cool down the whole house. At night also bed room was hot. AC air was not cooling the bedrooms. Rest it is reasonably priced. close to all amenities and train station.\nEmma and Rogers place was very lovely for our holiday. Very close to transport, close to lots of restaurants and big shopping centre westfield. It was a cozy place to stay away from home and also had a free parking for the stay which is rare . Most importantly, Emma and Roger were friendly and very responsive. We enjoyed our holiday at this place and recommend others as well.\nIt was really value for money also very nice apartment, only parking way is very difficult. But really good.\nHi Emma & Roger,<br\/>Thank you for letting my family stay at your apartment.<br\/>Positives about the place;  good communication by email, the offer for an early checkin, the option of a one night booking, the location, very spacious balcony, comfortable bed and mostly clean.<br\/>Issues, The apartment is advertised as having a  12pm checkout, this is not the case. The checkin instructions are great with photos but not detailed enough for anyone who has never used this type of keylock. The instructions also mentioned that the code had been sent, however it was not sent until the day of arrival so this was a bit confusing.  We were grateful to be advised before arrival that the air conditioner was not working, however unfortunately the apartment was stifling hot.<br\/>Could be a great place if the above issues are addressed.\nSerain is a nice place, and comfortable. It needs some work but it is priced appropriately."}

Air con kept me nice and cool after hot days out and about\nIdeally located for CBD and access to ferries. Lovely little studio apartment suitable for a couple. Sofa bed was difficult for third adult.\nPerfect location, decent apartment.<br\/>But if you are a light sleeper, don't go here! <br\/>the windows are extremely thin, so you year all traffic, drunk screaming and fighting tourists at both nights (weekdays), cars honking at night and extremely loud cleaning cars are 3.30 am. I could not get any rest, not even with earplugs.\nGood value for what you pay. Had trouble with the neighbours ringing our door bell at 6 in the morning - obviously not host fault. Very good location. Didn\u2019t get a response about how to turn the AC on, so was stuffy.\nFantastic place in the heart of Sydney.

The patio looking at the ocean looked at the ocean from a distance and was on the roofline.\nAlasdair\u2019s place was perfect for me. The guest bedroom and bathroom were immaculate with great facilities, the host was quiet and respectful whilst still checking in that I was ok. Can\u2019t fault location either. 100m from beach and short walk to Mahon Pool, so many buses do get where you need.\nAlastair was a great host. very friendly and open. great location and directly at the beach with many cafes and restaurants. didn\u2019t have access to the full kitchen but a few kitchen equipments (ea. photos).<br\/>but overall had a great stay with a comfy room and and nice clean towels:))\nIt is a nice room to rent if you want to stay near to Maroubra beach. Everything was clean and the Patio provides all you need.\nThis is THE most delightful place to stay in Maroubra!  Comfy room, cute apartment with ocean views from the breakfast table, friendly helpful host, all a few short steps from the beach! <br\/>I stayed for several nights and travelled into the city by bus which is convenient. <br\/>There are so many cafes and restaurants right next door you can stay in the immediate neighbourhood and eat well.<br\/>The home has its own mini kitchen with fridge and microwave which worked well for my breakfasts.  I visited solo but want to come back with my partner as it would be great for a couple. <br\/>Alasdair is a great host who has made the home delightful with a great ambiance and fresh atmosphere ideally suited to guests like me who want a combination of comfort, convenience, and value.  <br\/>Alasdair has great knowledge of local nature walks which he enthusiastically shares with guests too.<br\/>Highly recommend, I will be back soon and look forward to my next visit."}

Definitely recommend and would love to stay again.\nFantastic place. Close to Sydney Olympic park. Perfect spot to stay.\nGreat location, lots to do nearby. The parking spot is also a good one if you have children as it is next to a fire hose menacing you can open your door fully to get kids in and out. Great view from the balcony and host is very responsive. <br\/>Only down sides were the lack of necessities. We ended up having to purchase quite a lot of kitchen\/cooking items ourselves including peelers, cutting boards, baking pan, grater etc. there are also very minimal cleaning supplies which we also had to purchase ourselves. There\u2019s dish soap but no cloth, no tea towel or drying rack. There\u2019s a dishwasher but no dishwashing tablets and no washing machine powder either. There\u2019s also no cooking basics like oil, salt or pepper. These lack of necessities may not impact short stays but we were a family staying for 9 nights so these were very much needed.  <br\/>Would definitely stay here again and would be aware to pre-pack some of the basics.\nWei was fantastic to deal with, great place to stay\n\u53ef\u4ee5"}

Beautifully furnished, with balconies on both sides, including from the bedroom with views into a lush green garden courtyard. The dog, Boo Boo, is a sweet, friendly, sleepy old girl with a unique voice (she doesn't bark). It's a great neighbourhood in Surry Hills, extensive  parkland nearby,  cafes, bars, supermarket.

It was the perfect spot for our family. The location couldn't have been easier for walks to the Corso and the beaches. The home is beautiful and spacious and matched the pictures. We thoroughly enjoyed the deck and eating meals outside. Kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed.<br\/>Adam and Fiona were excellent hosts, helping with kids items, answering questions, and providing little extras. The icing on the cake was a bonus cleaning due to our extended stay! I've never had a host offer that and it was such a wonderful touch. Highly recommend if you're looking for a stay in and around Manly!\nNo complaints, our team thoroughly enjoyed their experience\nWhat a great little find in Manly.<br\/>Amazing views and literally a block away from the beach. Walking distance to everything and found the hosts great to communicate with. A lovely apartment for a weekend mini break.\nA lovely modern apartment close to all of Manly\u2019s key attractions. The host was very responsive and keen to accomodate our needs.\nWe had a fabulous stay. Everything was as per photos and description. The location was beautiful, with exceptional views across Sydney harbour. The apartment was well appointed, not cluttered and all necessities provided for. Communication with the hosts was seamless. We\u2019ll be back!\nThanks Adam & Fiona for a wonderful stay. Our family of four (children aged 5 & 8yrs) really enjoyed your apartment with its amazing view  and surrounding area.\nFrom The moment we stepped inside we felt right at home.<br\/>Our kids absolutely loved the place, when we walked in, and then to our surprise 5  friendly white Cockatoos came and perched  them selfs on the patio fence just outside our door, looking for a biscuit.<br\/>We will certainly be back there again.\nMy family and I had a lovely stay at Fiona and Adam\u2019s house. Upon arrival we were greeted with a beautiful hamper which was very much appreciated after a long day travelling. The apartment itself was beautifully furnished and had everything you could possibly need. I loved the kitchen layout which was very user friendly.   You can tell no expense has been spared with their appliance selection.  Fiona and Adam were fabulous hosts! They were always very helpful and responsive. We would definitely recommend their beautiful apartment to anyone wanting to visit Manly.\nGorgeous apartment with plenty of space and amenities in a perfect location. Absolutely amazing views and a beautiful home.\nSo responsive, warm and friendly couple with fresh baked bread on arrival. They place is serene with a beautiful view on the quiet side of Manly.

The room was clean and covered the basics, only tricky bit was navigating the bathroom after a shower when the water seems to flood a little bit into the main bathroom area until it dries up. Thanks for having us, very grateful for your hospitality!\nEasy check in, accessible on street parking. Listing was accurately described, clean, plenty of shops\/pubs near by. Hosts were very responsive and helpful. 100% would visit again. <br\/>Thank you for having us!\nWe had a great stay at this studio apartment! The host was very communicative and accommodating our flight arrived in Sydney two hours early, and since we had nowhere to go, we requested an early check-in, which she kindly allowed and we really appreciated. The studio is small but ideal for a single traveler, with impressive amenities, especially the sensor features, and everything was clean and well-maintained. While the stay was comfortable, all our tours operated from the main city, so we had to take an Uber daily, which became quite expensive. There is a pub nearby, but most hotels and restaurants are in the city, requiring frequent trips back and forth. Overall, it's a great option for solo travelers, but couples or those wanting to stay closer to the city's attractions might find the daily commute a bit inconvenient.\nThanks for the stay, great suburb. Nice little 20sqm pad,light, modern, nice bathroom, the old double doors on too the street view is quite European. It\u2019s is well provisioned. The rest of the building is a little tired.  But Xiaoyan\u2019s place is fresh and clean. AC much appreciated as it was a 41c day!!!! Good value. Kristan\nReally a good place! Will definitely come back here next time\nBeautiful cozy and compact place. We enjoyed our stay. It was closer to the city and walkable distance to the bus stop and plenty of street parking."}
{"listing_id":1292962723481046418,"comments":"Whilst the location and house was great, I am greatly disappointed with the overall experience and service from this company. <br\/>We paid $5200 for 2 nights which is an expensive trip. During our stay we experienced sewerage coming out of the shower, to the point where the bathroom was unusable and smelling disgusting. Furthermore, we found a mouldy old bowl of pasta in our microwave and the dishwasher was not working which left our kitchen dirty all weekend. <br\/>Whilst we addressed these isssues during our stay and they were attended to ( not the dishwasher ), I contacted the company to request compensation as we spent many hours in a house with sewerage all over our main bathroom. <br\/>They strictly declined any compensation. <br\/>I do not see how someone should have to pay full price for a service that was not fully provided. <br\/>Terrible customer service and would not reccomend."}

Lot of hills but makes for great exercise.<br\/>The place is small but good for 2 adults. The bed is a little small, but comfortable. You have all the amenities you need. Wifi was pretty decent.<br\/>It was really hot\/humid when we were there and there's not a lot of air circulation, but the portable fan helped. Very much worth the price.\nNicely renovated and furnished apartment, appreciated the laundry machine and kitchen. Peaceful neighborhood with some great caf\u00e9s, walking distance to catch the ferry from Darling Point to the city. <br\/>The apartment was smaller than I\u2018d expected. Fine for one person, but I can imagine that the ca. 1.20m bed and limited space could get crowded with two. The windows are facing the sun; there are remote-controlled blinds which didn\u2019t work while I was there. Despite multiple follow-ups, I did not get a response from the host on fixing this issue. Further, the windows open only a few centimeters and don\u2019t let in enough fresh air during the night to cool down the apartment. I was aware that there is no air conditioning but the available fan cannot compensate a day full of sun.\nThis was a perfect position in Potts  Point\/Elizabeth Bay. <br\/>A comfortable little bed-sit .\nI had a lovely stay, the area was very peaceful and had cafes etc nearby.

The soundproofing is not too great so you can hear neighbours if they are loud in the bedrooms and it's a bit of a struggle to unlock the building door entrance, but neither of these challenges are the host's fault.

So perfect for a morning coffee watching the sunrise, and an opportunity to escape the direct sun in the sweltering afternoon. I had no idea tranquility like this existed amongst the busyness of Bondi of all places! <br\/>As a host, Caroline was proactive and responsive and the instructions very ridiculously easy to navigate. Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone looking for places along the coast. <br\/>The only downside of our stay was that I booked theatre tickets for my wife on the wrong day!! Luckily we had plenty of privacy for me to be shouted at \ud83d\ude02<br\/>I\u2019ll do better next time!!\nI would definitely stay there again, the beds were so comfy and clean always hot water and the location was perfect and beautiful\nPrachtige locatie en een mooi zicht.\nmeget fin beliggenhet med utsikt over verdens fineste strand\namazing view and lovely place! Caroline was very helpful too!!\nIt was amazing\nWhat can I say? A hidden gem in the absolute middle of Bondi beach. Watching sunrise with a coffee was as easy as walking outside our front door and something my family and I really enjoyed!<br\/>The iconic icebergs next door was handy to have an afternoon beer looking over the beach too. It was so handy to have a few days of R&R in this location. Thank you for Caroline for her hospitality and responsiveness! 5\/5!\nWhat a place. The view of the beach from the house and garden is to die for. Was a pleasure staying here, only wish I could have stayed longer.\nThe apartment is in such a great spot, right on the beach and really close to the bus stop. Heaps of cute little food spots around too. The place is lovely too. Thanks for having us!\nWe had a wonderful stay at Caroline\u2019s place. We couldn\u2019t believe the location, views are incredible and it is quite literally a stones throw from the famous Icebergs pool and Bondi beach. We loved the coastal walk!

The location was excellent, right in the heart of Surry Hills with loads of great options for restaurants, bars, and coffee shops in walking distance.<br\/>A couple things to note:<br\/>\u2022The building only has one parking spot for visitors, so free parking onsite isn\u2019t necessarily guaranteed and finding free parking elsewhere in the area can be tricky, depending on the time of the week<br\/>\u2022 The custom spiral staircase was beautifully made and sturdy, but might be more difficult for elderly guests or small children to use<br\/>Overall this is a lovely place to stay when visiting Surry Hills!"}

{"listing_id":1318055518055910094,"comments":"Excellent Location making it easily accessible to the centre of Sydney and the main attractions. Very comfortable and all the facilities that you need. Reasonable price for a city centre location. The caretaker Martina was also on hand - we met her when we arrived . There was a local Aldi to buy items from and cafes located nearby. Easy to find and access.<br\/>The minor issues were the road noise which was evident early morning due to it being on a main road but soon got used to it and we had quite a few items for recycling but no recycling bin so we just kept them separate.<br\/>Although the house is advertised as 6 , 2 are on a sofa bed in the lounge\/kitchen area which would not be ideal and make it a bit cramped for everyone. The two queen beds were very comfortable.<br\/>Overall this met our requirements perfectly (family of 3 adults for 5 nights\/4 adults for 2 nights) . Tammy was very accommodating  in letting us add another adult at no extra charge which we had not prior booked  Thank you.\nGreat stay\nTammy\u2019s place in Darlinghurst is the perfect place to stay with friends to explore downtown Sydney. The beds were so comfy and the place has everything you need including air conditioning (so needed for the summers in Sydney), kitchenette, and a combo washer\/dryer.<br\/>You have easy access to Sydney\u2019s nightlife on Oxford street which is just up the road from the Airbnb. The main shopping areas on George and Pitt street are just 15 min away by transit. There are also coffee shops where you can grab a bite for breakfast or lunch just a step away.<br\/>One thing to note is that the two bedrooms and bathrooms are on the second and third floor so if you or your guests have mobility issues that could be a problem. <br\/>Tammy was really responsive to any questions I had. Overall, I highly recommend staying at this Airbnb.\nOutstanding Airbnb!  <br\/>On such short notice Tammy let us stay here.<br\/> With a 4 year old and a 9 year old we found this space and location to be brilliant.  The house was spotless and it had all of the essential items needed to make our stay easy and enjoyable.. <br\/>I Big Thank you to Martina for welcoming us to the property. We came from a terrible Airbnb to Tammy's place. Martina's welcome and warmth and kindness made us all feel at ease and looking forward to our stay, and our holiday to finally begin!<br\/>Thank you ladies.. if I could give you a 10 out of 5 I definitely would!!\nOne of my favourite areas in inner Sydney. Central to everything. Close to public transport for longer trips but walkable to everything in the inner east of Sydney. Modern version of a skinny townhouse you might find in Amsterdam. Polished concrete on bottom floor (entry) perfect for our dog to hang out and lot's of little parks, green spaces and laneways in the vicinity for her to explore and meet other dogs. And only a slightly longer walk to some larger parks\/recreational areas. Surrounded by great museums, galleries, restaurants, pubs and nightlife for the humans. A remarkably quiet and private apartment given its location with usual city sounds. The apartment is compact but really well planned, with a gorgeous timber staircase (3 levels), natural light via skylights and a fantastic balcony off the main bedroom on the 3rd floor (top level) that is surprisingly private and sheltered by a beautiful tree. Highly recommended for a stay just outside of the Sydney CBD in the inner East.\nThe apartment itself is lovely - beach vibes in the middle of the city. Very comfortable beds, including (incredibly), the sofa bed. The downstairs kitchen\/dining\/lounge is rather small, but functional. The 2 bedrooms on the upper two levels are beautiful. Shower pressure isn't the best but certainly passable. The location is great, in the centre of Darlinghurst but not too loud(I wore the very considerately host supplied ear plugs). Only a couple hundred metres to a well stocked Woolworths Metro supermarket, parking, central park(not all in the same direction). Tammy was a fantastic communicator.\nGreat place to stay & great location for getting in or out of the city.\nBEAUTIFUL PLACE <br\/>BEAUTIFUL HOST."}
