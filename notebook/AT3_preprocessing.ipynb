       "      <td>I enjoyed my time in colleen's place. Very friendly and helpful host. She provides maps, tips and detailed written instructions on how to get the most out of your day in exploring Sydney.\\nI advise not staying at this listing. That being said, please note that the following review is my personal experience only. Other travelers may have a better experience, I'm not sure, but I have to stay honest with my truth and write what happened to me.... So, check in started out relatively smoothly, besides the fact that Colleen was unresponsive to my texts, she was at the home when I arrived to let me in. Once inside I already began to feel uncomfortable. There was no space in the fridge for even my sandwich that I had brought, and the small space I was finally give had a cup of wet beansprouts and other borderline goods crowding/spilling onto my sandwich. The situation deteriorated from there. The shower was barely big enough to stand in and I was scolded for adjusting the shower head. The outlets in the room were on an extension cord that is designed so that a laptop charger won't fit on it to charge, there are cobwebs on the fan, and on top of all these I was bitten by what I think are bedbugs while laying down. On top of all this, the TV was so loud in the living room that I couldn't even rest. When I brought up the bedbug bites to the host she denied it, and said it was probably mosquitos, suggesting I should spray insecticide in the room. Not only is spraying poison in a bedroom a health hazard, but I had inspected the room, and mosquitos were not the issue, it was something in the sheets. Needless to say I left the home as fast as I could given the fact that I couldn't rest, I couldn't charge my laptop, and the other above issues. I had pre paid for 5 nights, and given I hadn't even stayed a single one, I asked Colleen to simply refund my $100 of the $360 dollars I spent on the home. She refused and continued to argue in messages. Not very host like or understanding. I have photos of the bedbug bites and have attempted to contact AirBnb to resolve the situation. Needless to say, I would recommend AVOIDING this place if you care about being comfortable. Thank goodness I was at least able to write a review. Again, this is just my experience, and other people might have a better time there, but be wary. No doubt the host will try and argue with what I've written but it's my right as a guest to leave a review, just like it's all guest's right. Anyways, that is all.\\nJe recommande ce logement, idéal si vous voyagez seul. Très bon emplacement et Colleen sera de très bon conseils.\\nColleen is a lovely host. Very polite.\\nColleen's place is really a green haven of peace in a area that usually doesn't feature on the beaten track of Syndey but is a welcome homely space to set off from. Very convenient and Colleen couldn't be a more hospitable host , with loads of tips and stories on the town :) Highly recommend, especially if you like a place with character.\\nColleen has always been very kind and polite to me. She is an extremely friendly and helpful person. In addition, he always offers advice on Sydney's tourist attractions. I do not rule out that if I ever come to Sydney again I will gladly visit Colleen. I would definitely recommend this host. Edmund\\nColleen made me feel very comfortable from the first second. She has very good Tipps. Busstop just in front of the house. Very easy to reach everything. Close to botanical gardens, nice cafes and restaurants very close. I would definitely stay at Colleens place again.\\nA wonderful and easy stay in Colleen’s home. Very comfortable, convenient and felt very welcomed in her home. Perfect location and some great little cafes around. Great for a solo traveller.\\nEverything is completely uncomplicated and the location speaks for itself ... I can only recommend a stay with Colleen.\\nColleen is a lovely and helpful host, and her apartment is in a great spot. She shares the whole space generously, and is so helpful for finding your way around Sydney.\\nColleen was a wonderful host! She’s lived such an amazing life and is full of great anecdotes. &lt;br/&gt;The flat is so lovely and home-y and really is an oasis in the center of the city!&lt;br/&gt;The location is perfect for a first time in Sydney, as it’s so close to buses and trains that easily connect you to any suburb you might want to visit! Plus, it’s within walking distance of the Opera House!&lt;br/&gt;I had an amazing stay with Colleen and cannot recommend her apartment more!\\nIt was a fantastic place with a lot of character and the area is just beautiful. Colleen is a great host that knows Sydney better then anyone.\\nColleen’s place is well appointed, close to public transport and nice walks; and overall very interesting. Colleen has a wealth of hosting and life experience. She is v understanding and trustworthy. I highly recommend this place to travellers who respect a broader view of life, and who want a central, elegant location.\\nColleen knows a lot about Sydney and is willing to help. Room has space.\\nI really enjoyed my stay in Sydney at Colleen’s place.  It was very clean and she had lots of maps and tour pamphlets to help get me around the city.</td>\n",

       "0  I enjoyed my time in colleen's place. Very friendly and helpful host. She provides maps, tips and detailed written instructions on how to get the most out of your day in exploring Sydney.\\nI advise not staying at this listing. That being said, please note that the following review is my personal experience only. Other travelers may have a better experience, I'm not sure, but I have to stay honest with my truth and write what happened to me.... So, check in started out relatively smoothly, besides the fact that Colleen was unresponsive to my texts, she was at the home when I arrived to let me in. Once inside I already began to feel uncomfortable. There was no space in the fridge for even my sandwich that I had brought, and the small space I was finally give had a cup of wet beansprouts and other borderline goods crowding/spilling onto my sandwich. The situation deteriorated from there. The shower was barely big enough to stand in and I was scolded for adjusting the shower head. The outlets in the room were on an extension cord that is designed so that a laptop charger won't fit on it to charge, there are cobwebs on the fan, and on top of all these I was bitten by what I think are bedbugs while laying down. On top of all this, the TV was so loud in the living room that I couldn't even rest. When I brought up the bedbug bites to the host she denied it, and said it was probably mosquitos, suggesting I should spray insecticide in the room. Not only is spraying poison in a bedroom a health hazard, but I had inspected the room, and mosquitos were not the issue, it was something in the sheets. Needless to say I left the home as fast as I could given the fact that I couldn't rest, I couldn't charge my laptop, and the other above issues. I had pre paid for 5 nights, and given I hadn't even stayed a single one, I asked Colleen to simply refund my $100 of the $360 dollars I spent on the home. She refused and continued to argue in messages. Not very host like or understanding. I have photos of the bedbug bites and have attempted to contact AirBnb to resolve the situation. Needless to say, I would recommend AVOIDING this place if you care about being comfortable. Thank goodness I was at least able to write a review. Again, this is just my experience, and other people might have a better time there, but be wary. No doubt the host will try and argue with what I've written but it's my right as a guest to leave a review, just like it's all guest's right. Anyways, that is all.\\nJe recommande ce logement, idéal si vous voyagez seul. Très bon emplacement et Colleen sera de très bon conseils.\\nColleen is a lovely host. Very polite.\\nColleen's place is really a green haven of peace in a area that usually doesn't feature on the beaten track of Syndey but is a welcome homely space to set off from. Very convenient and Colleen couldn't be a more hospitable host , with loads of tips and stories on the town :) Highly recommend, especially if you like a place with character.\\nColleen has always been very kind and polite to me. She is an extremely friendly and helpful person. In addition, he always offers advice on Sydney's tourist attractions. I do not rule out that if I ever come to Sydney again I will gladly visit Colleen. I would definitely recommend this host. Edmund\\nColleen made me feel very comfortable from the first second. She has very good Tipps. Busstop just in front of the house. Very easy to reach everything. Close to botanical gardens, nice cafes and restaurants very close. I would definitely stay at Colleens place again.\\nA wonderful and easy stay in Colleen’s home. Very comfortable, convenient and felt very welcomed in her home. Perfect location and some great little cafes around. Great for a solo traveller.\\nEverything is completely uncomplicated and the location speaks for itself ... I can only recommend a stay with Colleen.\\nColleen is a lovely and helpful host, and her apartment is in a great spot. She shares the whole space generously, and is so helpful for finding your way around Sydney.\\nColleen was a wonderful host! She’s lived such an amazing life and is full of great anecdotes. <br/>The flat is so lovely and home-y and really is an oasis in the center of the city!<br/>The location is perfect for a first time in Sydney, as it’s so close to buses and trains that easily connect you to any suburb you might want to visit! Plus, it’s within walking distance of the Opera House!<br/>I had an amazing stay with Colleen and cannot recommend her apartment more!\\nIt was a fantastic place with a lot of character and the area is just beautiful. Colleen is a great host that knows Sydney better then anyone.\\nColleen’s place is well appointed, close to public transport and nice walks; and overall very interesting. Colleen has a wealth of hosting and life experience. She is v understanding and trustworthy. I highly recommend this place to travellers who respect a broader view of life, and who want a central, elegant location.\\nColleen knows a lot about Sydney and is willing to help. Room has space.\\nI really enjoyed my stay in Sydney at Colleen’s place.  It was very clean and she had lots of maps and tour pamphlets to help get me around the city.  "
